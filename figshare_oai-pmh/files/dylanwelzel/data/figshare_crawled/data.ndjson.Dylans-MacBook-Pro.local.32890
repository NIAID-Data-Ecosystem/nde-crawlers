This finding changes the paradigm, as hitherto such\nprocesses have not been considered as plausible due to slow protonation\nof carbon and low (photo)­acidity of the NH<sub>2</sub> group. The\nESIPT was studied by irradiation of 2-(2-aminophenyl)­naphthalene in\nCH<sub>3</sub>CN–D<sub>2</sub>O, whereupon regiospecific incorporation\nof deuterium takes place at the naphthalene position 1, with a quantum\nyield of Φ = 0.11. A synergy of experimental and computational\ninvestigations completely unraveled the mechanism of this important\nphotochemical reaction. Upon excitation to the photoreactive S<sub>2</sub>(L<sub>a</sub>) state, a favorable redistribution of charge\nsets the stage for ESIPT to the carbon atom in naphthalene position\n1. H<sub>2</sub>O molecules are needed, as they increase the excitation\nenergy and oscillator strength for the population of the S<sub>2</sub>(L<sub>a</sub>) state.

Various\nderivatization methods have been developed; however, most are effective\nonly for monocarboxylic acids and not for those having multiple carboxyl\ngroups. Therefore, we successfully attempted to synthesize a derivatization\nreagent that could analyze both mono- and poly­(carboxylic acid)­s with\nhigh sensitivity. We optimized our derivatization reagent by modifying\nthe structure of the reaction site, hydrophobicity of the derivatized\ncompound, and linker structure connecting the reaction site to the\npermanently charged substructure. The reactivity toward carboxyl groups\nwas improved by employing a piperidine moiety as the reaction site,\nand the ESI efficiency was improved by the highly hydrophobic and\npermanently charged triphenylpyridinium group. Furthermore, the incorporation\nof an alkyl linker enabled polylabeling. When the optimized reagent\nwas applied to mono-, di-, tri-, and tetracarboxylic acids, the ESI\nefficiency increased with polylabeling; thus, our derivatization reagent\noutperforms existing derivatization methods and enables the analysis\nof poly­(carboxylic acid)­s with high sensitivity. Since this derivatization\nreagent can be applied to most carboxyl-containing compounds, it can\nbe widely used for lipidomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.","dateModified":"2022-06-28","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/jasms.2c00086.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/36069556"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/A_Pyridinium_Derivatization_Reagent_for_Highly_Sensitive_Detection_of_Poly_carboxylic_acid_s_Using_Liquid_Chromatography-Electrospray_Ionization-Tandem_Mass_Spectrometry/20173243","_id":"Figshare_20173243","identifier":"20173243","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-06-28"}

Unfortunately,\nthe commercialization of UVPDs based on WBSs is often limited by their\nrelatively high fabrication cost owing to the use of very complicated\ngrowth instruments. In this work, a sensitive UVPD based on non-WBS\nlead sulfide (PbS) with a relatively small band gap was proposed.\nDevice analysis revealed that the UVPD made of 48.5 nm PbS nanofilm\nwas highly sensitive to UV illumination at 365 nm. Specifically, the\nresponsivity and specific detectivity under 365 nm illumination were\n22.25 A W<sup>–1</sup> and 4.97 × 10<sup>12</sup> Jones,\nrespectively, which are comparable to or better than most of the conventional\nWBS-based UVPDs. The PbS nanofilm-based UVPD also exhibits excellent\nenvironmental stability. Experimental results and simulations based\non technology computer-aided design software confirmed that the abnormal\nproperties of PbS nanofilms are related to the relatively thin thickness\nand wavelength-dependent absorption coefficients. These results open\nup an opportunity for narrow band gap semiconductors to realize low-cost-sensitive\nUVPDs in future optoelectronic devices and systems.","dateModified":"2022-06-28","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/ACS Applied Nano Materials","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/acsanm.2c01059.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/36069528"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Ultraviolet_Photodetectors_Based_on_Nanometer-Thick_Films_of_the_Narrow_Band_Gap_Semiconductor_PbS/20173221","_id":"Figshare_20173221","identifier":"20173221","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-06-28"}

During our routine surveillance, 13 H5N1 viruses were isolated from 26,767 wild bird and poultry samples that were collected between September 2021 and March 2022 in China. To investigate the origin of these Chinese isolates and understand their genetic relationship with the globally circulating H5N1 viruses, we performed a detailed phylogenic analysis of 233 representative H5N1 strains that were isolated from 28 countries. We found that, after they emerged in the Netherlands, the H5N1 viruses encountered complicated gene exchange with different viruses circulating in wild birds and formed 16 genotypes. Genotype one (G1) was predominant, being detected in 22 countries, whereas all other genotypes were only detected in one or two continents. H5N1 viruses of four genotypes (G1, G7, G9, and G10) were detected in China; three of these genotypes have been previously reported in other countries. The H5N1 viruses detected in China replicated in mice, with pathogenicity varying among strains; the G1 virus was highly lethal in mice. Moreover, we found that these viruses were antigenically similar to and well matched with the H5-Re14 vaccine strain currently used in China. Our study reveals the overall picture of H5N1 virus evolution and provides insights for the control of these viruses.</p>","dateModified":"2022-06-14","sdPublisher":"Taylor & Francis Group/Emerging Microbes and Infections","@type":"Dataset","doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.20066128.v2","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/36069489"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Global_dissemination_of_H5N1_influenza_viruses_bearing_the_clade_2_3_4_4b_HA_gene_and_biologic_analysis_of_the_ones_detected_in_China/20066128","_id":"Figshare_20066128","identifier":"20066128","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-06-28","funding":{"funder":{"name":"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China: [Grant Number 2021YFD1800200, 2021YFC2301700]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Number 31521005, 32192451, 31802191, 31672593]; the Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture Project: [Grant Number NT2021007]; and by the China Agriculture Research System: [Grant Number CARS-41G12].","identifier":"0"}}}
