Herein, we successfully\nfabricated novel ZIF-67/CdS hollow sphere (HS) and ZIF-8/CdS HS heterostructures\nthrough an in situ self-assembly process, in which ZIF-67 and ZIF-8\nare closely coated on CdS HSs to form “double-shell”-like\nstructures. This hierarchical heterostructure with porous outer layers\non the surface of CdS HSs can expose accessible active sites and possess\nclose contact. Upon visible-light illumination, the optimal proportion\nof ZIF-67/CdS HS displays a hydrogen generation rate of 1721 μmol\ng<sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>, which is 11.9 and 3.1\ntimes higher than that of a pure CdS HS (145 μmol g<sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>) and ZIF-8/CdS HS (555 μmol g<sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>), respectively. The proposed photocatalytic\nmechanism is explored: ZIF-8/CdS HS follows the type-II mechanism,\nand ZIF-67/CdS HS follows the Z-scheme mechanism. The reason for the\nhigher photocatalytic activity of ZIF-67/CdS HS is that ZIF-67 not\nmerely with a porous structure facilitates the diffusion of H<sub>2</sub> gas, but with a well-matched band structure promotes charge\ntransfer and separation.","dateModified":"2022-06-28","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/Inorganic Chemistry","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c01697.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/36069559"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Self-Assembled_Zeolitic_Imidazolate_Framework_CdS_Hollow_Microspheres_with_Efficient_Charge_Separation_for_Enhanced_Photocatalytic_Hydrogen_Evolution/20173246","_id":"Figshare_20173246","identifier":"20173246","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-06-28"}

Various\nderivatization methods have been developed; however, most are effective\nonly for monocarboxylic acids and not for those having multiple carboxyl\ngroups. Therefore, we successfully attempted to synthesize a derivatization\nreagent that could analyze both mono- and poly­(carboxylic acid)­s with\nhigh sensitivity. We optimized our derivatization reagent by modifying\nthe structure of the reaction site, hydrophobicity of the derivatized\ncompound, and linker structure connecting the reaction site to the\npermanently charged substructure. The reactivity toward carboxyl groups\nwas improved by employing a piperidine moiety as the reaction site,\nand the ESI efficiency was improved by the highly hydrophobic and\npermanently charged triphenylpyridinium group. Furthermore, the incorporation\nof an alkyl linker enabled polylabeling. When the optimized reagent\nwas applied to mono-, di-, tri-, and tetracarboxylic acids, the ESI\nefficiency increased with polylabeling; thus, our derivatization reagent\noutperforms existing derivatization methods and enables the analysis\nof poly­(carboxylic acid)­s with high sensitivity. Since this derivatization\nreagent can be applied to most carboxyl-containing compounds, it can\nbe widely used for lipidomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.","dateModified":"2022-06-28","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/jasms.2c00086.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/36069556"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/A_Pyridinium_Derivatization_Reagent_for_Highly_Sensitive_Detection_of_Poly_carboxylic_acid_s_Using_Liquid_Chromatography-Electrospray_Ionization-Tandem_Mass_Spectrometry/20173243","_id":"Figshare_20173243","identifier":"20173243","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-06-28"}
