In this work we generated a metagenomic signature with predictive capacity to identify IBD from fecal samples. Different Machine Learning models were trained, obtaining high performance measures. The predictive capacity of the identified signature was validated in two external cohorts.

The results obtained in this validation (AUC 0.74 and AUC = 0.76, respectively) show that our signature presents a generalization capacity in both subtypes.

The pertinent boundary can support unified driving with the drivable area, in the meantime, can be pertinently modified to support the pertinent driving decisions for identified driving scenarios (e.g., car-following, junction left turning). It will further avoid the bump between the connections of the scenarios due to the continuity of space boundary. Thus, the planner is suitable for the fully autonomous driving. The proposed method is validated in different classical driving decision scenarios.
