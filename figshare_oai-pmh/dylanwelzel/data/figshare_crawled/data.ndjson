The first step of the analyses (START) is to determine whether the metacommunity exhibits positive, negative, or random coherence. Random coherence corresponds to NS metacommunity structure; negative coherence is a checkerboard pattern [<a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001289#pbio.3001289.ref045\" target=\"_blank\">45</a>], so significant mutual exclusivity between species and sites. Positive coherence indicates mutual co-occurring taxa associations, and there are several different possible models. For positive coherence, turnover and boundary clumping are calculated to determine the type of metacommunity structure. Nonsignificant turnover corresponds to quasi structures. These EMF analyses enable the structure of metacommunities to be grouped into one of 14 models: (1) random; (2) checkerboard; (3–5) nested clumped, random, and hyperdispersed; (6–8) Clementsian, Gleasonian, and evenly spaced; (9–10) Quasi nester clumped and hyperdispersed; and (11–12) quasi Clementsian and evenly spaced.

Current deep LLIE models still face two issues: low-quality detail-recovery result due to information loss, and complex model design. On one hand, current methods usually adopt U-Net with multiple feature scaling operations as main structure, but feature scaling inevitably loses informative visual primitives, which will result in blur textures and inaccurate illumination. On the other hand, current models are usually complicated and even redundant, which goes against the original goal of building plain model to effectively handle the LLIE task. To address these issues, we branch out to propose a simple yet effective deep LLIE architecture, termed Full-Resolution Context Network (FRC-Net). Specifically, to avoid information loss caused by feature scaling, we propose a novel full-resolution representation strategy to replace all feature scaling operations. The model structure of FRC-Net is very simple, which only contains 12 cascaded layers: 7 convolution layers and 5 newly-designed context attention (CA) modules. CA module is mainly designed to overcome the limited receptive field caused by shallow structures, by not only learning global context but also retaining local details.

In this study, we investigate the separation of chiral amino\nacids (AAs) forming trinuclear complexes that can be directly resolved\nby IM-MS analyses. Twenty standard AAs of both d- and l-chirality were investigated. Specific AAs including d/l-histidine, d/l-proline, d/l-glutamine, d/l-tyrosine, and d/l-tryptophan were evaluated as “chiral selectors”\nthat, when combined with copper, were found to promote selective complexation\nwith specific AA enantiomers. Significant enantiomer differentiation\nwas observed in the IM spectra for hydrophobic AAs acids with peak-to-peak\nresolutions ranging from 0.63 to 1.15. Among the chiral selectors\ninvestigated, histidine provided the best enantioselectivity, followed\nby tryptophan, suggesting the aromatic structure plays an important\nrole in forming chiral-specific ion complexes. Unlike MS/MS methods\nwhere chiral selectors with l-stereochemistry enhance the\ndifferentiation, the chirality of the selector was found to have no\nsignificant effect on observed IM separation with both d-\nand l-selectors providing similar resolutions but with inverted\nIM arrival time ordering.

In the present work, an analytical model is presented for estimating the 3-dimensional (3D) magneto quasi-static fields of the cylindrical solenoid with helix-shaped (helical) wire winding. The proposed integral formulation is based on the Schur (Hadamard) vector product of the current vector I and the helical tangent vector T, to express the magnetic vector potential A. The model is used to estimate the magnetic flux density vector B and the flux linkage Psi anywhere in 3D space, excluding the (source) regions of conducting wire. A constant scaling coefficient, based on measured terminal inductance, is proposed for calibration of the model's magnetic field. Error analysis is presented on the numerical integration, based on truncated series expansion of complete elliptic integrals in terms of Chebychev polynomials. The model may be used to estimate all three cylindrical components of the magneto quasi-static fields of solenoids as a function of core diameter, wire radius, the number of wire turns per winding layer, the number of winding layers, and the complex permeability of frequency-dependent linear material. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the helical model against the superposition of circular loops, and an idealized circuit model.","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"TechRxiv/Submissions","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Preprint"]},"doi":"10.36227/techrxiv.19769044.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35123632"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/A_Parametric_Integral_Formulation_to_Approximate_the_Magneto_Quasi-Static_Fields_of_3D_Cylindrical_Solenoids_with_Helical_Winding/19769044","_id":"Figshare_19769044","identifier":"19769044","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

The overall accuracy (OA) of the PRs classification obtained in the literature is still moderate, particularly for machine learning (ML)-enabled ANNs, where OA is around 65%, resulting in 35% critical wrong decisions. To improve such an OA, a three-stage ML-assisted algorithm employing both support vector machines (SVMs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) techniques is proposed. Starting with a well-fitted PR accuracies distribution and using mathematical modeling, the global optimal accuracies’ interval of misclassified patients (OIMP) is obtained, and a novel theorem for the generalized secretary problem is introduced and used to select the most likely well-classified patients. The algorithm’s final phase consists of flipping the remaining incorrectly classified patients in the OIMP. Using the presented approach with ANN and SVM, the OA was raised by 5% and 19%, respectively.

However, the accuracy of the driving energy predictions is often affected by a high degree of uncertainty due to unknown and constantly varying terrain properties, and the complex wheel-terrain interaction in unstructured terrains. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic deep meta-learning approach to model the existing uncertainty in the driving energy consumption and efficiently adapt the probabilistic predictions based on a small number of local measurements. Our method expands upon an existing deterministic deep-meta learning model that, in contrast, only provided single-point energy estimates. The performance of our method is compared against the deterministic approach in a 3D-body dynamic simulator over several typologies of deformable terrains and unstructured geometries. In this way, we provide evidence of the benefit of the proposed method to enhance the predictions with informative probabilistic considerations, which can be crucial to the safety of mobile robots traversing challenging, unstructured environments.","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"TechRxiv/Submissions","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Preprint"]},"doi":"10.36227/techrxiv.19768366.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35122585"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/Probabilistic_Meta-Conv1D_Driving_Energy_Prediction_for_Mobile_Robots_in_Unstructured_Terrains/19768366","_id":"Figshare_19768366","identifier":"19768366","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17","funding":{"funder":{"name":"EUROfusion 101052200","identifier":"0"}}}

For expeditious diagnosis and quantitative image analysis in large-scale clinical trials, there is a compelling need to predict segmentation quality without ground truth. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework to locate erroneous regions on the boundary surfaces of segmented objects for quality control and assessment of segmentation. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is explored to learn the boundary related image features of multi-objects that can be used to  identify location-specific inaccurate segmentation. The predicted error locations can facilitate efficient user interaction for interactive image segmentation (IIS). We evaluated the proposed method on two data sets: Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) 3D knee MRI and 3D calf muscle MRI. The average sensitivity scores of $0.96\\pm0.00$ and $0.96\\pm0.02$, and the average positive predictive values of $0.87\\pm0.01$ and $0.93\\pm0.03$ were achieved, respectively, for erroneous surface region detection of knee cartilage segmentation and calf muscle segmentation. Our experiment demonstrated promising performance of the proposed method for segmentation quality assessment by automated detection of erroneous surface regions in medical images.","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"TechRxiv/Submissions","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Preprint"]},"doi":"10.36227/techrxiv.19767661.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35120011"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/Segmentation_Quality_Assessment_by_Automated_Detection_of_Erroneous_Surface_Regions_in_Medical_Images/19767661","_id":"Figshare_19767661","identifier":"19767661","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17","funding":{"funder":{"name":"National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering","identifier":"R01EB004640"}}}

Due to large magnetic-field-induced strains of Ni-MnGa, actuating components can be fabricated in the Ni-Mn-Ga layers. Other functional components can be manufactured in silicon layer. Single crystalline Ni-Mn-Ga alloys that are grown by using the Bridgman vertical growth technique obtained so far the largest Magnetic Field Induced Strain (MFIS), a Magnetic Shape Memory (MSM) effect. Like silicon wafers, Ni-Mn-Ga wafers are also sliced from crystal-oriented single crystalline ingots. For fabricating hybrid MEMS devices such as micromanipulators and robots, lab-on-chip containing micro-pump manifolds and valves, or vibration energy harvesters, the fabrication processes used for MEMS devices will be used also for fabricating components in the NiMn-Ga layer of the hybrid MEMS devices. One of the most important processes for MEMS fabrication is the structuring of materials by chemical etching. Main goal of this study is to prove the etchant that etches silicon but not Ni-Mn-Ga and to find an etchant that etches Ni-Mn-Ga but not silicon.

In this paper, we investigate a downlink IRS-aided multi-carrier (MC) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where the IRS is deployed to especially assist the blocked users to establish communication with the base station (BS). To maximize the system sum rate under network quality-of-service (QoS), rate fairness and successive interference cancellation (SIC) constraints, we formulate a problem for joint optimization of IRS elements, sub-channel assignment and power allocation. The formulated problem is mixed non-convex. Therefore, a novel three stage algorithm is proposed for the optimization of IRS elements, sub-channel assignment and power allocation. First, the IRS elements are optimized using the bisection method based iterative algorithm. Then, the sub-channel assignment problem is solved using one-to-one stable matching algorithm. Finally, the power allocation problem is solved under the given sub-channel and optimal number of IRS elements using Lagrangian dual-decomposition method based on Lagrangian multipliers. Moreover, in an effort to demonstrate the low-complexity of the proposed resource allocation scheme, we provide the complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms. The simulated results illustrate the various factors  that impact the optimal number of IRS elements and the superiority of the proposed resource allocation approach in terms of network sum rate and user fairness. Furthermore, we analyse the proposed approach against a new performance metric called computational efficiency (CE).","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"TechRxiv/Submissions","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Preprint"]},"doi":"10.36227/techrxiv.19767127.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35118973"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/Intelligent_Radio_Resource_Management_in_Reconfigurable_IRS-enabled_NOMA_Networks/19767127","_id":"Figshare_19767127","identifier":"19767127","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

Accurately assessing the direct impact of pain-related anxiety and fear on pain behavior has proved difficult. Studies have demonstrated no or limited influence of pain-related fear and anxiety on behavior but this may be due to inherent problems with the scales used. Neuroimaging has improved the understanding of neural processes underlying the factors that influence pain perception. This study aimed to establish if a Picture and Imagination Task (PIT), largely developed from the Photographs of Daily Activity (PHODA) assessment tool, could help explore how people living with chronic pain process information about daily activities. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to compare brain responses in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSKP) (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15). Subjects were asked to imagine how they would feel mentally and physically if asked to perform daily activities illustrated in PIT. The results found that a number of regions involved in pain processing saw increased BOLD activation in patients compared with controls when undertaking the task and included the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus and inferior and superior parietal cortices. Similarly, increased BOLD responses in patients compared to controls in the frontal pole, paracingulate and the supplementary motor cortex may be suggestive of a memory component to the responses The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, substantia nigra/ventral tegmentum, putamen, thalamus, pallidum, inferior parietal (supramarginal and angular gyrus) and cingulate cortex were also seen to have greater differences in BOLD signal changes in patients compared with controls and many of these regions are also associated with general phobic responses. Therefore, we suggest that PIT is a useful task to explore pain- and movement-related anxiety and fear in fMRI studies. Regions in the Default Mode Network remained active or were less deactivated during the PIT task in patients with CMSKP compared to healthy controls supporting the contention that the DMN is abnormal in patients with CMSKP. </p>","dateModified":"2015-10-23","sdPublisher":{"name":"Public Library of Science"},"@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142307"},"language":"en","url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/A_Functional_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_Study_to_Investigate_the_Utility_of_a_Picture_Imagination_Task_in_Investigating_Neural_Responses_in_Patients_with_Chronic_Musculoskeletal_Pain_to_Daily_Physical_Activity_Photographs/19780198","_id":"Figshare_19780198","identifier":"19780198","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17","funding":{"funder":{"name":"This work was supported by Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (https://www.hefcw.ac.uk/home/home.aspx to RW), Welsh Institute of Cognitive Neurosciences (http://psych.cf.ac.uk/wicn/ to AMT, AV, RP, OH, JH, RGW), National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia (http://www.niaa.org.uk/ to AT, RGW, JH, OH, AV, RP) and the Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (NSERC of Canada (http://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.html to ADH).","identifier":"0"}}}

It is added to many foods and is used to increase dietary fibre, replace fats or carbohydrates, and as a prebiotic (a stimulant of beneficial bacteria in the colon). Oligofructose, which is also present in these foods, produces similar effects and most research has used a combination of these products. A previous study (Smith, 2005) investigated the effects of regular consumption of oligofructose-enriched inulin on wellbeing, mood, and cognitive performance in humans. The results showed that oligofructose-enriched inulin had no negative effects but that it did not improve wellbeing, mood, or performance. The aim of the present study was to examine the acute effects of oligofructose-enriched inulin (5 g) over a 4 h period during which the participants remained in the laboratory.

On each test day mood and cognitive performance were assessed at baseline (at 8:00) and then following inulin or placebo (at 11:00). Prior to the second test session (at 10:30) participants completed a questionnaire assessing their physical symptoms and mental health during the test morning. The inulin and placebo were provided in powder form in 5 g sachets. Volunteers consumed one sachet in decaffeinated tea or decaffeinated coffee with breakfast (9:00). Questionnaire results showed that on the day that the inulin was consumed, participants felt happier, had less indigestion and were less hungry than when they consumed the placebo. As for performance and mood tasks, the most consistent effects were on the episodic memory tasks where consumption of inulin was associated with greater accuracy on a recognition memory task, and improved recall performance (immediate and delayed). Further research is required to identify the mechanisms that underlie this effect with glucose metabolism being one candidate. </p>","dateModified":"2015-10-28","sdPublisher":{"name":"MDPI"},"@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142268"},"language":"en","url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/An_investigation_of_the_acute_effects_of_oligofructose_enriched_inulin_on_subjective_wellbeing_mood_and_cognitive_performance/19780189","_id":"Figshare_19780189","identifier":"19780189","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

This problem, coupled with the lack of novel therapeutics in the development pipeline, means AMR is reaching crisis point, with an expected annual death rate of ten million people worldwide by 2050. To reduce, and to potentially remedy this problem, many researchers are looking into natural compounds with antimicrobial and/or antivirulence activity. Manuka honey is an ancient antimicrobial remedy with a good track record against a wide range of nosocomial pathogens that have increased AMR. Its inhibitory effects are the result of its constituent components, which add varying degrees of antimicrobial efficacy to the overall activity of manuka honey. The antimicrobial efficacy of manuka honey and some of its constituent components (such as methylglyoxal and leptosperin) are known to bestow some degree of antimicrobial efficacy to manuka honey. Despite growing in vitro evidence of its antimicrobial efficacy, the in vivo use of manuka honey (especially in a clinical environment) has been unexpectedly slow, partly due to the lack of mechanistic data. The mechanism by which manuka honey achieves its inhibitory efficacy has recently been identified against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with both of these contrasting organisms being inhibited through different mechanisms. Manuka honey inhibits S. aureus by interfering with the cell division process, whereas P. aeruginosa cells lyse in its presence due to the reduction of a key structural protein. In addition to these inhibitory effects, manuka honey is known to reduce virulence, motility, and biofilm formation. With this increasing in vitro dataset, we review the components and our mechanistic knowledge of manuka honey and how manuka honey could potentially be utilized in the future to impact positively on the treatment of microbial, resistant infections. </p>","dateModified":"2015-10-29","sdPublisher":{"name":"Dove press"},"@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142211"},"language":"en","url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/On_the_antibacterial_effects_of_manuka_honey_mechanistic_insights/19780165","_id":"Figshare_19780165","identifier":"19780165","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

Objective To investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a universal school-based preventative programme (FRIENDS) in reducing symptoms of anxiety and low mood. Design Cluster randomised controlled trial. Schools (n = 41) were randomly assigned after recruitment on a 1 : 1 : 1 basis to health-led FRIENDS, school-led FRIENDS and usual school provision. Setting Primary schools in three local education authorities in the south-west of England. Participants Children (n = 1362) aged 9–10 years attending school and participating in personal, social and health education (PSHE). Interventions The FRIENDS programme is a cognitive–behavioural therapy programme that develops skills to counter the cognitive, emotional and behavioural aspects of anxiety. The FRIENDS programme was led by either a trained member of the school or a health leader external to the school and was delivered over 9 consecutive weeks. The comparison group received usual school PSHE lessons. Interventions were delivered in the academic year September 2011–July 2012. Main outcome measures Clinical effectiveness assessed by child report of symptoms of anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale, RCADS); cost-effectiveness based on RCADS and quality-adjusted life-years (Child Health Utility 9 Dimensions, CHU-9D) between baseline and 6 months; process evaluation, evaluation of reach and attrition and qualitative feedback from children, school staff and parents. Results At 12 months there was a difference in the adjusted mean RCADS scores for health-led FRIENDS compared with school-led FRIENDS [–3.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) –6.48 to –1.35] and for health-led FRIENDS compared with usual school provision (–2.66, 95% CI –5.22 to –0.09). At 24 months we were able to assess only 43.6% of our cohort. There were few differences in baseline characteristics between completers and non-completers. Child-reported anxiety in all three groups had reduced by 24 months and there were no longer any group effects. There were no between-group effects for any parent- or child-completed secondary outcomes at 12 or 24 months. The cost of the FRIENDS programme was £52–56 per child. We found no evidence that the FRIENDS programme was cost-effective over a 6-month period; however, our subgroup for the economic analysis differed significantly from our main trial cohort. Conclusions Although greater reductions in anxiety were noted at 12 months when the FRIENDS programme was delivered by health leaders, these additional benefits were not maintained at 24 months. Children’s anxiety levels improved irrespective of the intervention that they received. Our economic evaluation and 24-month assessment had significant shortcomings. However, the universal delivery of specific anxiety prevention programmes will result in additional costs that may be beyond the finances available to most schools. Future work should identify the active ingredients and potential moderators of universal anxiety programmes to determine whether programme length can be reduced, short-term effectiveness maintained and cost-effectiveness improved. At present, our results find limited evidence to support the universal provision of specific anxiety prevention programmes in UK primary schools. </p>","dateModified":"2015-11-01","sdPublisher":{"name":"NIHR Journals Library"},"@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35141950"},"language":"en","url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/A_cluster_randomised_controlled_trial_comparing_the_effectiveness_and_cost-effectiveness_of_a_school-based_cognitive_behavioural_therapy_programme_FRIENDS_in_the_reduction_of_anxiety_and_improvement_in_mood_in_children_aged_9_10_years/19779955","_id":"Figshare_19779955","identifier":"19779955","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

In audiology literature, several studies have examined the attitudes and behavior of people with hearing loss; however, not much is known about the manner in which society in general views and perceives hearing loss. This exploratory study was aimed at understanding the social representation of hearing loss (among the general public) in the countries of India, Iran, Portugal, and the UK. We also compared these social representations. Materials and methods: The study involved a cross-sectional design, and participants were recruited using the snowball sampling method. A total of 404 people from four countries participated in the study. Data were collected using a free-association task where participants were asked to produce up to five words or phrases that came to mind while thinking about hearing loss. In addition, they were also asked to indicate if each word they presented had positive, neutral, or negative associations in their view. Data were analyzed using various qualitative and quantitative methods. Results: The most frequently occurring categories were: assessment and management; causes of hearing loss; communication difficulties; disability; hearing ability or disability; hearing instruments; negative mental state; the attitudes of others; and sound and acoustics of the environment. Some categories were reported with similar frequency in most countries (eg, causes of hearing loss, communication difficulties, and negative mental state), whereas others differed among countries. Participants in India reported significantly more positive and fewer negative associations when compared to participants from Iran, Portugal, and the UK. However, there was no statistical difference among neutral responses reported among these countries. Also, more differences were noted among these countries than similarities. Conclusion: These findings provide useful insights into the public perception of hearing loss that may prove useful in public education and counseling. </p>","dateModified":"2015-11-19","sdPublisher":{"name":"Dove Press"},"@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35140351"},"language":"en","url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Social_representation_of_hearing_loss_Cross-cultural_study_in_India_Iran_Portugal_and_the_United_Kingdom/19779040","_id":"Figshare_19779040","identifier":"19779040","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

The purpose of this current research was to examine whether ‘not knowing the load ‘during a mid-thigh pull (MTP) performance led to enhanced performance characteristics across a randomised selection of loads (75%-95% 1RM). Fifteen male collegiate athletes (age 21.8 ± 2.3, height 171.8 ± 7.5 cm, mass 89.3kg ± 9.8kg, MTP 1RM 135.5kg ± 18kg) were selected for the pre 1RM MTP and the 5 post randomised unknown lifts between 75%-95% of individual 1RM. The research demonstrated that unknown loads at 75% 1RM lead to significant changes in average power (AP) (known1062±251 W, unknown1213 ± 289W; p ≤ 0.05; effect size (ES) = 0.56 small).

There was also a significant change in peak velocity (PV) at 75% 1RM (known: 0.74±0.16, unknown: 0.95 ± 0.26m/s; p ≤ 0.05; ES = 0.99 moderate). Unknown loads at 80% 1RM lead to significant changes in AV (known: 0.47±0.10 unknown: 0.60 ± 0.10m/s; p ≤ 0.01; ES = 1.36 large). There was no significant difference in AP, AV, peak power (PP) and PV variables across 85, 90, 95% 1RM (p ≥ 0.05; ES = trivial to small). It appears that these findings especially at unknown loads between 75% and 80% 1RM could be beneficial in enhancing velocity-based performance variables. Therefore, the applications of unknown loads are of meaningful practical use to enhance performance variables during weightlifting pulling derivatives. Therefore, weightlifting pulling derivatives are potentially a useful training modality to improve desirable ballistic actions in particular triple extension. </p>","dateModified":"2018-01-01","sdPublisher":{"name":"ARC"},"@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35139892"},"language":"en","url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/The_Effect_of_Load_Deception_on_Kinetic_Variables_during_the_Second_Pull_from_Blocks_of_the_Power_Clean/19778887","_id":"Figshare_19778887","identifier":"19778887","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

However, few researches were found about this skill. There is knowledge about the forces needed to perform the cross, or about muscles activation, separately. The aim of this paper was to accomplish a comprehensive research about the biomechanics of cross on rings, in order to obtain a descriptive model about this skill. Therefore, the currently Olympic champion on rings event volunteered in this research. He performed three crosses with the usual apparatus in his training gym. The measurement methods were combined: One digital video camera, one strain gauge in each cable and surface electromyography of nine right shoulder muscles were used. Statistical analyses were performed by parametric and non parametric tests and descriptive statistics. Symmetry values were calculated for shoulder angles and cables of right and left side. Coefficient of variation of muscle activation and co contraction were verified. Within gymnast variability was calculated using biological coefficient of variation (BCV), discretely for kinematic measures. Low variability values of shoulder angles and cable forces were verified and low values of asymmetry as well.

Computation of the intractable posterior is often done with three-block Gibbs samplers (3BG), based on representing the shrinkage priors as scale mixtures of Normal distributions. An alternative computing tool is a state of the art Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method, which can be easily implemented in the Stan software. However, we found both existing methods to be inefficient and often impractical for large <i>p</i> problems. Following the general idea of Rajaratnam et al., we propose two-block Gibbs samplers (2BG) for three commonly used shrinkage models, namely, the Bayesian group lasso, the Bayesian sparse group lasso, and the Bayesian fused lasso models. We demonstrate with simulated and real data examples that the Markov chains underlying 2BG’s converge much faster than that of 3BG’s, and no worse than that of HMC. At the same time, the computing costs of 2BG’s per iteration are as low as that of 3BG’s, and can be several orders of magnitude lower than that of HMC. As a result, the newly proposed 2BG is the only practical computing solution to do Bayesian shrinkage analysis for datasets with large <i>p</i>. Further, we provide theoretical justifications for the superior performance of 2BG’s. We establish geometric ergodicity of Markov chains associated with the 2BG for each of the three Bayesian shrinkage models. We also prove, for most cases of the Bayesian group lasso and the Bayesian sparse group lasso model, the Markov operators for the 2BG chains are trace-class. Whereas for all cases of all three Bayesian shrinkage models, the Markov operator for the 3BG chains is not even Hilbert–Schmidt. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2020.1864383\" target=\"_blank\">Supplementary materials</a> for this article are available online.</p>","dateModified":"2020-12-22","sdPublisher":"Taylor & Francis Group/Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics","@type":"Dataset","doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.13480302.v3","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35143130"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Fast_Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo_for_high_dimensional_Bayesian_regression_models_with_shrinkage_priors/13480302","_id":"Figshare_13480302","identifier":"13480302","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

The procedure is based on a novel frequency-domain factor model that provides a flexible yet parsimonious representation of spectral matrices from a large number of simultaneously observed time series. Real and imaginary parts of the factor loading matrices are modeled independently using a prior that is formulated from the tensor product of penalized splines and multiplicative gamma process shrinkage priors, allowing for infinitely many factors with loadings increasingly shrunk toward zero as the column index increases. Formulated in a fully Bayesian framework, the time series is adaptively partitioned into approximately stationary segments, where both the number and locations of partition points are assumed unknown. Stochastic approximation Monte Carlo techniques are used to accommodate the unknown number of segments, and a conditional Whittle likelihood-based Gibbs sampler is developed for efficient sampling within segments. By averaging over the distribution of partitions, the proposed method can approximate both abrupt and slowly varying changes in spectral matrices. Performance of the proposed model is evaluated by extensive simulations and demonstrated through the analysis of high-density electroencephalography. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2020.1868305\" target=\"_blank\">Supplementary materials</a> for this article are available online.</p>","dateModified":"2021-01-04","sdPublisher":"Taylor & Francis Group/Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics","@type":"Dataset","doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.13519115.v4","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142950"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Adaptive_Bayesian_Spectral_Analysis_of_High-dimensional_Nonstationary_Time_Series/13519115","_id":"Figshare_13519115","identifier":"13519115","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17","funding":{"funder":{"name":"This work was funded in part by PSC-CUNY Research Award 63069-0051, a Eugene M.

Principal component analysis is a linear dimensionality reduction method in the sense that each principal component is a linear combination of the input variables. To allow features that are nonlinear functions of the input variables, many nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) methods have been proposed. In this article, we propose novel NLDR methods based on bottleneck deep autoencoders. Our contributions are 2-fold: (1) We introduce a monotonicity constraint into bottleneck deep autoencoders for estimating a single nonlinear component and propose two methods for fitting the model. (2) We propose a new, forward stepwise deep learning architecture for estimating multiple nonlinear components. The former helps extract interpretable, monotone components when the assumption of monotonicity holds, and the latter helps evaluate reconstruction errors in the original data space for a range of components. We conduct numerical studies to compare different model fitting methods and use two real data examples from the studies of human immune responses to HIV to illustrate the proposed methods. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2020.1856119\" target=\"_blank\">Supplementary materials</a> for this article are available online.</p>","dateModified":"2020-12-04","sdPublisher":"Taylor & Francis Group/Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics","@type":"Dataset","doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.13333852.v4","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142944"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Forward_Stepwise_Deep_Autoencoder-based_Monotone_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction_Methods/13333852","_id":"Figshare_13333852","identifier":"13333852","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17","funding":{"funder":{"name":"This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01-AI122991; UM1-AI068635; S10OD028685).","identifier":"0"}}}

One particular objective of anomaly detection from a neuroscience perspective is the reconstruction of the dynamic manner of brain region interactions. However, most statistical methods for detecting anomalies have the following unrealistic limitation for brain studies and beyond: that is, network snapshots at different time points are assumed to be independent. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a distribution-free framework for anomaly detection in dynamic networks. First, we present each network snapshot of the data as a linear object and find its respective univariate characterization via local and global network topological summaries. Second, we adopt a change point detection method for (weakly) dependent time series based on efficient scores, and enhance the finite sample properties of change point method by approximating the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic using the sieve bootstrap. We apply our method to simulated and to real data, particularly, two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets and the Enron communication graph. We find that our new method delivers impressively accurate and realistic results in terms of identifying locations of true change points compared to the results reported by competing approaches. The new method promises to offer a deeper insight into the large-scale characterizations and functional dynamics of the brain and, more generally, into the intrinsic structure of complex dynamic networks.

In this article, we study convergence and statistical properties of two-dimensional canonical correlation analysis under an assumption that data come from a probabilistic model. We show that carefully initialized the power method converges to the optimum and provide a finite sample bound. Then we extend this framework to tensor-valued data and propose the higher-order power method, which is commonly used in tensor decomposition, to extract the canonical directions. Our method can be used effectively in a large-scale data setting by solving the inner least squares problem with a stochastic gradient descent, and we justify convergence via the theory of Lojasiewicz’s inequalities without any assumption on data generating process and initialization. For practical applications, we further develop (a) an inexact updating scheme which allows us to use the state-of-the-art stochastic gradient descent algorithm, (b) an effective initialization scheme which alleviates the problem of local optimum in nonconvex optimization, and (c) a deflation procedure for extracting several canonical components.

To explicitly incorporate the alternating structure of the problem, we propose a novel model selection based approach for simultaneous inference on both change-points and alternating states.

The analysis of these data needs to rely on local models to account for the nonstationarity of the generating random process, the nonlinearity of the manifold, and the complex topology of the domain. In this article, we propose to use a random domain decomposition approach to estimate an ensemble of local models and then to aggregate the predictions of the local models through Fréchet averaging. The algorithm is introduced in complete generality and is valid for data belonging to any smooth Riemannian manifold but it is then described in details for the case of the manifold of positive definite matrices, the hypersphere and the Cholesky manifold. The predictive performances of the method are explored via simulation studies for covariance matrices and correlation matrices, where the Cholesky manifold geometry is used.

Furthermore, the analysis not only captures the mere presence of misinformative content but in addition whether the source websites are affiliated with a key misinformation actor (Russia’s ruling elites) and whom the conspiracy narratives cast as the malicious plotters.

Importantly, such a result was maintained when controlling for soil, geographical location and vegetation attributes, being pH and soil organic carbon important determinants of the relative abundance of the ecological clusters. We also identified potential global associations between important soil microbial taxa, which can be useful to support the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems under global change scenarios. Our results suggest that increases in temperature and aridity such as those forecasted for the next decades in drylands could potentially lead to drastic changes in the community composition of functionally important bipartite networks within soil food webs. This could have important but unknown implications for the provision of key ecosystem functions and associated services driven by the organisms forming these networks if other taxa cannot cope them.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years’.","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"The Royal Society/Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.19780466.v1","url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Appendix_S1_Materials_and_Methods_-_Figs_S1_to_S5_-_Tables_S1_to_S3_from_Ecological_clusters_of_soil_taxa_within_bipartite_networks_are_highly_sensitive_to_climatic_conditions_in_global_drylands/19780466","_id":"Figshare_19780466","identifier":"19780466","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

Previous research suggests that it can increase consumption of highly palatable food in some individuals, but decrease it in others. Thus, we developed the Cyberball-Milkshake Task (CMT), to facilitate research investigating individual differences in ostracism’s effects on consumption of highly palatable food. We present data on feasibility for the CMT in a sample of young adult women.</p>Materials and Methods<p>Participants were 22 women, 18–30 years old, reporting very low or very high levels of emotional eating at screening. Participants performed the CMT, which consisted of 12 trials. Each trial included: playing a round of Cyberball (a computerized game of catch with fictitious “other participants” programmed to either include or exclude the participant); viewing a chocolate image; and then consuming a participant-determined amount of milkshake. Participants subsequently played an additional inclusion and exclusion round of Cyberball, each immediately followed by questionnaires assessing current mood and recent Cyberball experience.</p>Results<p>Cyberball exclusion (vs. inclusion) was associated with large, significant increases in reported ostracism and threats to self-esteem; exclusion’s effects on affect were in the expected direction (e.g., increased negative affect), but generally small and non-significant. Milkshake intake was measurable for 95% of participants, on 96% of trials. Intake decreased quadratically across trials, with a steep negative slope for low trial numbers that decreased to the point of being flat for the highest trial numbers.</p>Discussion<p>The CMT is a generally feasible approach to investigating ostracism’s effects on consumption of highly palatable food. The feasibility (and validity) of the CMT may benefit from modification (e.g., fewer trials and longer rounds of Cyberball). Future research should examine whether performance on a modified version of the CMT predicts real-world behavior in a larger sample.</p>","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"Frontiers/Frontiers in Psychology","@type":"Dataset","doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.853555.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142829"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_Sheet_1_Measuring_Ostracism-Induced_Changes_in_Consumption_of_Palatable_Food_Feasibility_of_a_Novel_Behavioral_Task_docx/19780465","_id":"Figshare_19780465","identifier":"19780465","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

How the interaction of genes shapes CHC profiles, which are essential for insect survival, adaptation and reproductive success, is still poorly understood. Here we investigate the genetic and genomic basis of CHC biosynthesis and variation in parasitoid wasps of the genus <i>Nasonia</i>. We mapped 91 quantitative trait loci (QTL) explaining the variation of a total of 43 CHCs in F<sub>2</sub> hybrid males from interspecific crosses between three <i>Nasonia</i> species. To identify candidate genes, we localized orthologues of CHC biosynthesis-related genes in the <i>Nasonia</i> genomes. We discovered multiple genomic regions where the location of QTL coincides with the location of CHC biosynthesis-related candidate genes. Most conspicuously, on a region close to the centromere of chromosome 1, multiple CHC biosynthesis-related candidate genes co-localize with several QTL explaining variation in methyl-branched alkanes.

SFD particles have been advanced as drug\ncarrier systems, but the quantitative description of the morphology\nformation in the SFD process is still challenging. Here, the pore\nspace dimensions of SFD particles prepared from aqueous dextran solutions\nof varying molecular weights (40–200 kDa) and concentrations\n(5–20%) are analyzed using scanning electron microscopy.

Particles\nwith low-aspect ratio cellular pores showing variation of around 0.5–1\nμm in diameter with precursor composition but roughly constant\nwith particle diameter are ascribed to a rapid growth regime with\nhigh nucleation site density.

Particles with\nhighly elongated cellular pores without lamellar formation show intermediate\npore dimensions between the above two limiting morphological types.\nAnalysis of variance and post hoc tests indicate that dextran concentration\nis the most significant factor in affecting the pore dimensions.

In contrast to traditional schemes, we propose to locate two independent traces close to each other. The strong electromagnetic coupling thus formed can cause unwanted crosstalk between traces.

Two prototypes of such TLs in the form of a serpentine and a spiral were made in which the far-end crosstalk voltage waveforms do not exceed 4.4% of the useful signal amplitudes. We performed electrodynamic simulations and measurements of such TLs in a transverse electromagnetic cell in the frequency range from 10 MHz to 5.3 GHz. The investigated lines have a low level of radiated emissions. Experimental results show that the proposed TLs decrease the voltage amplitude of the ultra-wideband pulse by at least 4 times and the voltage change rate by 10.7 times and more. In addition, the effective voltage value on the load is decreased by at least 2.2 times. The spiral scheme was found to be better than the serpentine scheme in almost all parameters.

For driving safety and comfort, especially in highly automated vehicles, there is a need for accurate and efficient way to estimate the road condition ahead in advance. Existing direct sensing based methods are difficult to give detailed irregularity information, while current response based approaches require either too many measurements or accurate system parameters to guarantee estimation performances. Therefore, using the information of preceding vehicle responses, a Kalman filter based algorithm to estimate severe road irregularities is proposed.

CARM1 catalyzes methyl group\ntransfer from the cofactor <i>S</i>-adenosyl-l-methionine\n(AdoMet) to both histone and nonhistone protein substrates. CARM1\nis involved in a range of cellular processes, mainly involving RNA\ntranscription and gene regulation.

Because hybridization ignores\nintricate differences in the energy and size of valence atomic orbitals,\nits naïve application to classically bonded boron atoms leads\nto numerous surprises in bond strengths, frontier MOs/bands, and even\ngeometry. Here we show that the sp dissonance caused by size mismatch\nbetween the valence s and p orbitals of boron plays a crucial role\nin its bonding, subtly distinct from that of carbon and silicon. Unlike\nthe heavier p block elements, boron prefers to actively engage its\ncompact 2s orbitals in bonding. This leads to the overreach of p–p\nσ-type overlap that reduces its magnitude in the entire BB\nbonding range. Consequently, the π-type overlap remains substantial,\nmaking its electronic structure visibly distinct in saturated and\nunsaturated regimes. The deltahedral frameworks offer a compromise\nby breaking this symmetry-enforced dichotomy of classical σ-\nand π-type bonding and following alternate electron counts that\nsuit the electron deficiency of the boron. The pathological anatomy\nof classical BB σ-bonding also explains the origins\nof puzzling metallic character and disorder in their classical boride\nnetworks even with ideal electron count, unlike deltahedral borides.\nThe implications of sp dissonance are illustrated in classical boron\nnetworks of various hybridizations, explaining the unusual preference\nfor unique sp<sup>3</sup> lattice with strained four-membered rings\nin CrB<sub>4</sub>, origins of observed σ holes in MgB<sub>2</sub> that lead to its superconducting nature, and the absence of Peierls\ndistortion in LiB.","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/The Journal of Physical Chemistry A","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/acs.jpca.2c01981.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142740"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Anatomy_of_Classical_Boron_Boron_Bonding_Overlap_and_sp_Dissonance/19780397","_id":"Figshare_19780397","identifier":"19780397","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

Understanding the impact and consequences of this resource mix transition is crucial to maintaining reliable grid operations. Aiming at this, the paper examines the impact of increasing RESs on the oscillatory behavior of the U.S. Western Interconnection (WI). Two approaches were used in the paper for performing this assessment: measurement- and model-based. In the measurement-based approach, quantile-regression-based correlation analysis was performed using historical data collected from the WI to analyze the impact of increasing RES penetration levels on system modes. In the model-based approach, the 2018 heavy summer operating WI model was used as a base-case to create several use-cases by replacing synchronous machine models with RES machine models in different proportions to analyze the impact of increasing RES penetration levels on the system modes. In this analysis, four scenarios were considered that included system-wide and area-specific increases in RES penetration levels. In the model-based approach, a detailed eigenvalue analysis was also performed to understand the trends observed in the damping ratio of system modes. Our detailed analysis concludes that the increasing RES penetration levels can have a significant impact on system modes. However, no single trend could be identified to correlate the impact of the increasing RES penetration levels on system modes. According to our model-based analysis, this impact was, in fact, dependent on the group of synchronous generators that were replaced by the RES machine models; for instance, replacing synchronous generators in Alberta, that have high participation factors and significantly contribute to the damping of the NS-A mode, had the most impact on the NS-A mode, while the impact on the NS-A mode was little when synchronous generators were replaced in the rest of the WI. Based on this analysis, the authors conclude that the impact of the increasing RES penetration level on a system mode is dependent on the overall dynamics of the evolving system and the damping contribution to that mode by the generators having high participation factors in that mode.</pre>","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"TechRxiv/Submissions","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Preprint"]},"doi":"10.36227/techrxiv.19765603.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35116072"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/A_Detailed_Analysis_of_the_Impact_of_Increasing_Inverter-Based_Resources_on_the_Oscillatory_Behavior_of_the_Western_Interconnection/19765603","_id":"Figshare_19765603","identifier":"19765603","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17","funding":{"funder":{"name":"Advanced Grid Modeling (AGM) program under U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity","identifier":"0"}}}

Single cultures and a co-culture of enterocytes and mucus-secreting cells were established to investigate the mucus role. Toxicological endpoints including cytotoxicity, ROS production, intestinal permeability increase, and actin filament disruption were addressed after a 7-day exposure. The results showed a size-dependent effect of silica nanoparticles on cytotoxicity and intestinal permeability. A time-dependent disruption of actin filaments was observed in Caco-2 cells. The mucus layer spread on the HT29-MTX single culture acted as an efficient protective barrier while in the co-culture, small nanoparticles were able to cross it to reach the cells. From a hydrodynamic diameter of 70 nm, nanoparticles were not internalized in the intestinal cells, even in mucus-free models. Digestion did not affect the physicochemical properties of the additive.

Various groups have proposed dimer structures that are similar to the A-type and B-type dimerization modes of peroxiredoxins. Computational methods are used to compare the sequence of Dio3<sup>Trx</sup> to related proteins known to form A-type and B-type dimers. Sequence analysis and <i>in silico</i> protein-protein docking methods suggest that Dio3<sup>Trx</sup> is more consistent with proteins that adopt B-type dimerization. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the refined Dio3<sup>Trx</sup> dimer constructed using the SymmDock and GalaxyRefineComplex databases indicate stable dimer formation along the β<sub>4</sub>α<sub>3</sub> interface consistent with other Trx fold B-type dimers. Free energy calculations show that the dimer is stabilized by interdimer interactions between the β-sheets and α-helices. A comparison of MD simulations of the <i>apo</i> and thyroxine-bound dimers suggests that the active site binding pocket is not affected by dimerization. Determination of the transition state for deiodination of thyroxine from the monomer structure using QM/MM methods provides an activation barrier consistent with previous small model DFT studies.</p> <p>Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

These families are the first ones known to exhibit a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal phase. Here, we present an experimental investigation of the phase diagram and electro-optics of binary mixtures of RM734 and DIO. We observe paraelectric nematic and ferroelectric nematic phases in both materials, each of which exhibits complete miscibility across the phase diagram, showing that the paraelectric and ferroelectric are the same phases in RM734 and DIO. Remarkably, these molecules form ideal mixtures with respect to both the paraelectric–ferroelectric nematic phase behaviour and the ferroelectric polarisation density of the mixtures, the principal order parameter of the transition. Ideal mixing is also manifested in the orientational viscosity, and the onset of glassy dynamics at low temperature. This behaviour is attributable in part to the similarity of their overall molecular shape and net longitudinal dipole moment, and to a common tendency for head-to-tail molecular association. In contrast, the significant difference in molecular structures leads to poor solubility in the crystal phases, enhancing the stability of the ferroelectric nematic phase at low temperature in the mixtures and enabling room-temperature electro-optic effects.</p>","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"Taylor & Francis Group/Liquid Crystals","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.19780368.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142696"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Ideal_mixing_of_paraelectric_and_ferroelectric_nematic_phases_in_liquid_crystals_of_distinct_molecular_species/19780368","_id":"Figshare_19780368","identifier":"19780368","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17","funding":{"funder":{"name":"This work was supported by NSF Condensed Matter Physics Grants [DMR 1710711 and DMR 2005170], and by Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) Grant [DMR 1420736].","identifier":"0"}}}

We aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of liver in HBV-ACLF patients by using multiple approaches including transcriptome analysis. We performed transcriptomic sequencing analysis on the liver of HBV-ACLF patients (n = 6), chronic hepatitis B (n = 6), liver cirrhosis (n = 6) and normal control (n = 5), then explored the potential pathogenesis mechanism in liver specimen from another 48 subjects and further validated the molecular and cellular mechanism using THP-1 cells. RNA-sequencing data analysis indicated that, among the genes up-regulated in HBV-ACLF, genes related to inflammatory response and chemotaxis accounted for a large proportion of the total DEGs. A number of key chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CCL20, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8) and NF-ĸB pathway were identified to be robust in the liver samples from HBV-ACLF patients. Interestingly, cylindromatosis (CYLD) was found to be downregulated in the liver of HBV-ACLF patients, in line with the well-established role of CYLD in regulating most of the chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines (CCL2, CCL5, CCL20, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, IL-6, IL-1β) via inhibition of NF-ĸB. Indeed, knockdown of CYLD resulted in sustained activation of NF-ĸB in macrophages and enhanced chemokines and inflammatory cytokines production, which in turn enhanced chemotactic migration of neutrophil, monocyte, T lymphocytes and NK cell. In conclusions, down-regulated CYLD aggravated inflammatory cell chemotaxis through enhancing NF-κB activation in HBV-ACLF patients, thereby participating in the pathogenesis of HBV-ACLF injury.</p>","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"Taylor & Francis Group/Emerging Microbes and Infections","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Online resource"]},"doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.19780365.v1","url":"https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/Down-regulated_cylindromatosis_enhances_NF-_B_activation_and_aggravates_inflammation_in_HBV-ACLF_patients/19780365","_id":"Figshare_19780365","identifier":"19780365","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

The proposal offers low-level constructions for reported speech, non-dedicated passive and reflexive, and stance verb constructions, which capture the patterns, abstracted from recurring usage events, that are part of users’ linguistic knowledge.

Youth overwhelmingly report utilizing the Internet to gather information while psychiatric symptoms emerge, however, most are not yet ready to receive a referral to care, forestalling the established benefit of early intervention.</p>Methods<p>A digital outreach campaign and interactive online care navigation platform was developed and deployed in New York State on October 22, 2020. The campaign offers live connection to a peer or counselor, a self-assessment mental health quiz, and educational material all designed to promote help-seeking in youth and their allies.</p>Results<p>Between October 22, 2020 and July 31, 2021, the campaign resulted in 581,981 ad impressions, 16,665 (2.9%) clicks, and 13,717 (2.4%) unique website visitors. A third (4,562, 33.2%) completed the quiz and 793 (0.1%) left contact information. Of those, 173 (21.8%) completed a virtual assessment and 155 (19.5%) resulted in a referral to care. The median age of those referred was 21 years (IQR = 11) and 40% were considered to be from low-income areas.

Therefore, augmentation of mitophagy, the process by which defective mitochondria are removed, then replaced by new ones, is an emerging strategy for preventing the evolvement of multiple morbidities in the elderly population. Based on the scaffold of spermidine (Spd), a known mitophagy-promoting agent, we designed and tested a family of structurally related compounds. A prototypic member, 1,8-diaminooctane (VL-004), exceeds Spd in its ability to induce mitophagy and protect against oxidative stress. VL-004 activity is mediated by canonical aging genes and promotes lifespan and healthspan in <i>C. elegans</i>. Moreover, it enhances mitophagy and protects against oxidative injury in rodent and human cells. Initial structural characterization suggests simple rules for the design of compounds with improved bioactivity, opening the way for a new generation of agents with a potential to promote healthy aging.</p>","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"Taylor & Francis Group/Autophagy","@type":"Dataset","doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.19780274.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142422"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Distinct_designer_diamines_promote_mitophagy_and_thereby_enhance_healthspan_in_i_C_elegans_i_and_protect_human_cells_against_oxidative_damage/19780274","_id":"Figshare_19780274","identifier":"19780274","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17","funding":{"funder":{"name":"This work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation [989/19];vitalunga ltd;cleveland clinic center for transformative nanomedicine;","identifier":"0"}}}

However, the effect of anoxia, a critical feature of the carcinoma cell microenvironment, on cypA expression in NSCLC is unknown. Here, formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples were collected from 60 subjects with NSCLC. The protein expression levels of cypA and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that subjects with high cypA expression had remarkably shorter progression-free survival than those with low cypA expression. Furthermore, cypA expression levels were significantly related to HIF-1α expression levels (Spearman’s correlation=0.34, P<0.0001). To further assess the effect of cypA, an anoxic carcinoma cell model was established. CypA expression was remarkably upregulated in H1299 and A549 cell lines under hypoxic conditions. Overexpression of cypA restored hypoxia-impaired cell growth and prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death in hypoxic A549 and H1299 cells. However, these phenotypes were not altered by the inactive R55A mutant of cypA. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that cypA can bind to and degrade the tumor suppressor protein TXNIP in H1299 and A549 cells. Restored TXNIP expression in cypA-overexpressed and hypoxic NSCLC cells led to increased ROS levels and apoptotic cell numbers and decreased cell growth compared with cypA-overexpressed and hypoxic NSCLC cells. These findings indicate that anoxia results in an increase in cypA expression in NSCLC. Additionally, cypA served as an oncogene during hypoxia by interacting with TXNIP.</p>","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"Taylor & Francis Group/Cell Cycle","@type":"Dataset","doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.19780272.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142378"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Cyclophilin_A_represses_reactive_oxygen_species_generation_and_death_of_hypoxic_non-small-cell_lung_cancer_cells_by_degrading_thioredoxin-interacting_protein/19780272","_id":"Figshare_19780272","identifier":"19780272","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

The HFMNs swell by imbibing interstitial skin fluid (ISF), and they facilitate drug transport from the reservoir attached at the base into the skin without polymer dissolution. To develop HFMNs for practical applications, a complete understanding of the drug transport mechanism is required, allowing for controlled TDD and geometrical optimisation. A three-phase system consisting of a reservoir, microneedle, and skin is considered. A mathematical model is developed to incorporate the drug binding within the matrix of the compartment, which was not considered earlier. Super-swelling nature of the HFMNs is incorporated through the swelling ratio obtained experimentally for a polymer. The results are validated with in vitro diffusion studies of ibuprofen sodium (IBU) across excised porcine skin, showing that around 20% of the loaded IBU in lyophilised wafer was delivered in 24 hours. It was observed that increasing IBU solubility in reservoir can achieve high drug transport across the skin. The developed model is shown to be in good agreement with the experimental data. It is concluded that the proposed model can be considered a tool with predictive design and development of super-swelling HFMNs based TDD systems.</p>","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":{"name":"Elsevier"},"@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"language":"en","url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Super-swelling_hydrogel-forming_microneedle_based_transdermal_drug_delivery_mathematical_modelling_simulation_and_experimental_validation/19767244","_id":"Figshare_19767244","identifier":"19767244","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17","funding":{"funder":{"name":"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India","identifier":"0"}}}

The detection of rabies virus\n(RABV) is critical and remains a significant challenge. Herein, an\nelectrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) and electrochemical\n(EC) dual-mode immunosensor was developed for highly sensitive detection\nof RABV glycoprotein. Dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs)\nwere employed to load Ru­(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup> and to obtain\nECL probes (Ru@DMSNs). Ru@DMSNs were decorated on the electrode surface,\nfollowed by the modification of the RABV antibody (Ab<sub>1</sub>).\nRABV was specifically recognized and captured by Ab<sub>1</sub>, causing\nthe decline of the ECL signal due to the obstruction of electron transfer.\nAdditionally, manganese oxide nanoparticles (MnO<sub>x</sub>) modified\nwith Ab<sub>2</sub> can further quench the ECL signal of Ru@DMSNs\nvia the RET between Ru@DMSNs and MnO<sub>x</sub>. Meanwhile, MnO<sub>x</sub> can catalyze the oxidation of <i>o</i>-phenylenediamine\n(<i>o</i>-PD), generating a significant differential pulse\nvoltammetry (DPV) signal as a second signal to monitor RABV glycoprotein\nconcentration. Consequently, an immunosensor was developed to achieve\ndual-signal detection of RABV and improve reliability. Under the optimal\nconditions, detection ranges of 0.10 pg·mL<sup>–1</sup> to 10 ng·mL<sup>–1</sup> for ECL (with an 88 fg·mL<sup>–1</sup> detection limit) and 1 pg·mL<sup>–1</sup> to 2 ng·mL<sup>–1</sup> for EC (with a 0.1 pg·mL<sup>–1</sup> detection limit) were obtained for RABV detection.\nThe reliability of this immunoassay was validated by eight brain tissue\nsamples. The results were found to be compatible with the results\nof the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nassay, indicating the potential applicability of this method for RABV\ndiagnosis.","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/Analytical Chemistry","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.2c00954.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142338"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Dual-Mode_Immunosensor_for_Electrochemiluminescence_Resonance_Energy_Transfer_and_Electrochemical_Detection_of_Rabies_Virus_Glycoprotein_Based_on_Ru_bpy_sub_3_sub_sup_2_sup_-Loaded_Dendritic_Mesoporous_Silica_Nanoparticles/19780238","_id":"Figshare_19780238","identifier":"19780238","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

The introduction of\nSZ into the VCMBR enhanced the average TN removal efficiencies up\nto 68.1%, which were much higher than 29.1% in the ASCMBR with SZ.\nReversible and irreversible fouling were simultaneously reduced in\nthe VCMBR due to significant reductions of the DOMs in the fouling\nlayer.

Whether these aspects of value-based decision-making in people with addiction are stable and trait-like, and the degree to which they vary within-person and are sensitive to changes in psychological state, remains unknown. In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility of distinguishing these state- vs. trait-like components by probing day-level dynamics of risk and time preferences in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) as they engaged with their natural environment.</p>Methods<p>Twenty-three individuals with OUD receiving outpatient treatment (40% female; M = 45.67 [SD = 13.16] years of age) and twenty-one matched healthy community controls (47% female; M = 49.67 [SD = 14.38] years of age) participated in a 28-day smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment study (1085 person days; M = 24.66, SD = 5.84). Random prompts administered daily assessed subjects’ psychological state (e.g., mood) and economic preferences for real delayed and risky monetary rewards.</p>Results<p>Subjects demonstrated dynamic decision-making preferences, with 40–53% of the variation in known risk and ambiguity tolerance, and 67% in discounting, attributable to between-person vs. within-person (day-to-day) differences. We found that changes in psychological state were related to changes in risk preferences, with patients preferring riskier offers on days they reported being in a better mood but no differences between groups in aggregate level behavior. By contrast, temporal discounting was increased overall in patients compared to controls and was unrelated to global mood. The study was well-tolerated, but compliance rates were moderate and lower in patients.</p>Conclusion<p>Our data support the idea that decision-making preferences in drug addiction exhibit substantial within-person variability and that this variability can be well-captured using remote data collection methods. Preliminary findings suggested that aspects of decision-making related to consideration of risk may be more sensitive to within-person change in global psychological state while those related to consideration of delay to reward, despite also being somewhat variable, stably differ from healthy levels. Identifying the cognitive factors that contribute to opioid use risk in a “real-world” setting may be important for identifying unique, time-sensitive targets for intervention.</p>","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"Frontiers/Frontiers in Psychiatry","@type":"Dataset","doi":"10.3389/fpsyt.2022.817979.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142214"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_Sheet_1_A_Proof-of-Concept_Ecological_Momentary_Assessment_Study_of_Day-Level_Dynamics_in_Value-Based_Decision-Making_in_Opioid_Addiction_pdf/19780168","_id":"Figshare_19780168","identifier":"19780168","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

With the advancement and\nprogress in the study of MHP SCs, it is found that the properties\nat the surface and bulk of SCs are significantly different. However,\nthere are only a few studies present for the facet-dependent performance\nof MHP SCs. In this work, we have systematically investigated the\nanisotropic properties of naturally exposed facets ((100) and (112))\nin MAPbI<sub>3</sub> SCs. We studied the influence of temperature\nand illumination on the properties of these facets. It was found that\nhysteresis at the (112) facet is higher than that at the (100) facet\nbecause of the higher trap density of 1.17 × 10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>–3</sup> at this facet as compared to the trap density of\n2.11 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>–3</sup> for the (100) facet.\nAlthough there exist different kinds of defects at both the facets,\nthe ion migration mechanism remains the same at both facets, which\nis confirmed by the obtained almost same activation energy of 0.378\nand 0.308 eV for (100) and (112) facets, respectively, for ion migration.\nThe photocurrent, responsivity, and EQE values further confirm anisotropic\nproperties of both the facets in MAPbI<sub>3</sub> SCs although they\nare the same from the crystallography point of view. Thus, this study\nprovides a detailed and systematic investigation of the facet-dependent\nproperties in MHP SCs.","dateModified":"1753-01-01","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/The Journal of Physical Chemistry C","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c01743.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35142159"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Investigation_on_the_Facet-Dependent_Anisotropy_in_Halide_Perovskite_Single_Crystals/19780131","_id":"Figshare_19780131","identifier":"19780131","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"1753-01-01"}

In this work, by expanding the training set, developing\nphysically meaningful features, employing our recently developed linear\nempirical scoring function Lin_F9 (Yang, C.  J. Chem. Inf.

Besides the top performances\nfor scoring-ranking-screening power tests of the CASF-2016 benchmark,\nthe new scoring function Δ<sub>Lin_F9</sub>XGB also achieves\nsuperior scoring and ranking performances in different structure types\nthat mimic real docking applications. The scoring powers of Δ<sub>Lin_F9</sub>XGB for locally optimized poses, flexible redocked poses,\nand ensemble docked poses of the CASF-2016 core set achieve Pearson’s\ncorrelation coefficient (<i>R</i>) values of 0.853, 0.839,\nand 0.813, respectively.

To accomplish this, we prepared three new green and\nhigh-efficiency antifouling coatings containing phthalimide derivatives\ninspired by capsaicin (PDIC-AC) by using a collaborative strategy\nthat incorporates self-polishing, fouling repelling, and antifouling\nproperties. Static simulation tests confirmed that the zinc acrylate\nresin of the PDIC-AC has excellent self-polishing properties due to\nchanges in the roughness, surface free energy, and mass loss.

We highlight three main findings. First, intragenerational wage fluctuations are stronger in the United States compared with Germany. Second, wage fluctuations translate into steeper trends of upward mobility in Germany, but the heterogeneity in wage trends across individuals and the year-to-year volatility around the individual trends are larger in the United States. Lastly, we find persistent intragenerational wage inequality by gender, social origin, education, and race.

Within alkaline\nsystems, earth-abundant electrocatalysts could provide both these\nrequirements. However, a continued exploration of the reactivity and\nthe causes behind different behaviors in performance are necessary\nto guide optimization and design. In this paper, Ta-doped NiO thin\nfilms are prepared via DC magnetron sputtering (1–2–4\nat % Ta) to demonstrate the effect of surface electronic modulation\nby non-3d elements on the catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction\n(OER). Material properties of the catalysts are analyzed via Rutherford\nbackscattering spectrometry, X-ray diffractometry, photoelectron spectroscopy,\nand Raman spectroscopy. Ta impurities are shown to be directly responsible\nfor increasing the valence state of Ni sites and enhancing reaction\nkinetics, resulting in performance improvements of up to 64 mV at\n10 mA cm<sup>–2</sup> relative to pristine NiO. Particularly,\nwe show that by applying <i>operando</i> Raman spectroscopy,\nTa enhances the ability to create high-valence Ni in γ-NiOOH\nat a lower overpotential compared to the undoped sample.

CNTs can trigger a charge disbalance and propagate\nthis effect into a thin-layer membrane domain under mildly polarization\nconditions. With the exceptional selectivity and the fast establishment\nof new concentration profiles provided by the thin-layer membrane,\na selective ion capture from the solution is expected, which is necessarily\nlinked to the charge generation on the CNTs lattice. As a proof-of-concept,\nwe investigated an arrangement based on a layer of CNTs modified with\na nanometer-sized, potassium-selective membrane to conform an actuator\nthat is in contact with a thin-layer aqueous solution (thickness of\n50 μm). The potassium ion content was fixed in the solution\n(0.1–10 mM range), and the system was operated for 120 s at\n−400 mV (with respect to the open circuit potential). A 10-fold\ndecrease from the initial potassium concentration in the thin-layer\nsolution was detected through either a potentiometric potassium-selective\nsensor or an optode confronted to the actuator system.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of LXA4 via synovial macrophage M1/M2 subtype polarization on chondrocyte pyroptosis and mechanisms during mechanical stimulation. Synovial macrophages were subjected to various LXA4 concentrations and cyclic tensile strain (CTS) conditions to determine optimal co-culture conditions. The effects of LXA4 on chondrocyte pyroptosis, as represented by macrophage M1/M2 subtype polarization, were detected by western blot, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry analyses. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10): control group (CG), OA group (OAG), OA with moderate-intensity treadmill exercise (OAE), and OAE + BOC-2 (an LXA4 antagonist). All rats were evaluated using histology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative PCR, and western blot analyses. We found that LXA4 was downregulated in articular fluid and that CD 86/Arg 1 was up-regulated in the synovium of patients with increasing Kellgren-Lawrence grade. In vitro, CTS and LXA4 both promoted M2 subtype polarization of synovial macrophages, inhibiting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and the NLRP3 formation in chondrocytes. In vivo, the OAE treatment exerted protective effects on articular cartilage and facilitated M2 polarization of synovial macrophages. These effects were suppressed by BOC-2 treatment. We concluded that moderate CTS enhances the therapeutic effects of LXA4 by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and NLRP3. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of LXA4 during treadmill exercise in monoiodoacetate-induced OA were driven by promotion of synovial macrophage M2 subtype polarization.</p>","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"figshare","@type":"Dataset","doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.19779985.v2","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35141980"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Untitled_ItemMechanical_Stress_Protects_Against_Chondrocyte_Pyroptosis_through_Lipoxin_A4_via_Synovial_Macrophage_M2_Subtype_Polarization_in_an_Osteoarthritis_Model/19779985","_id":"Figshare_19779985","identifier":"19779985","license":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

This property is attributed to the presence of natural forces, such as wind, which cause the transport and dispersion of these variables. This spatio-temporal dynamics prompted the use of the Lagrangian reference frame alongside any Gaussian spatio-temporal geostatistical model. Under this modeling framework, a whole new class was birthed and was known as the class of spatio-temporal covariance functions under the Lagrangian framework, with several developments already established in the univariate setting, in both stationary and nonstationary formulations, but less so in the multivariate case. Despite the many advances in this modeling approach, efforts have yet to be directed to probing the case for the use of multiple advections, especially when several variables are involved. Accounting for multiple advections would make the Lagrangian framework a more viable approach in modeling realistic multivariate transport scenarios.

Vegetation structure, food availability, and human activity are often used to guide conservation efforts, such as protected area zoning and reforestation, especially for primates. We sought to determine whether Critically Endangered golden-crowned sifaka (<em>Propithecus tattersalli</em>) densities could be predicted across a heterogeneous landscape as a function of vegetation structure, food availability, and human activity. We conducted walking transect surveys across the sifakas’ entire global range in the Loky-Manambato Protected Area of Madagascar from 2016–2018, expanding upon a study conducted in 2006/2008. Potential predictors of sifaka density included metrics of vegetation structure (e.g., tree density, forest type), food availability (e.g., food tree basal area, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), and human activity (e.g., tree cutting, livestock grazing). Low-intensity tree cutting and wet season NDVI were the best, positive predictors of sifaka densities. Our results suggest that from 2008-2018, populations declined by 30-43%, from at least 18,000 (estimated confidence interval of 11,000 – 26,000) to 10,222-12,631 individuals. Sifaka densities within study units across their restricted range (880 km2) were highly variable (range: 6.8-78.1 sifakas/km2), emphasizing the importance of large-scale and randomized study designs for assessing species abundance, regardless of its area of occupancy. Understanding that wet season NDVI was a positive predictor of sifaka densities can aid managers in prioritizing conservation actions in this region using widely available and remotely sensed data. </p>","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":{"name":"University Libraries, Virginia Tech"},"@type":"Dataset","doi":"10.7294/19778806.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35139850"},"language":"English (US)","url":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_to_accompany_the_paper_Highly_variable_densities_and_a_decline_in_critically_endangered_golden-crowned_sifaka_Propithecus_tattersalli_population_abundance_from_2008-2018_International_Journal_of_Primatology_In_review_2022_/19778806","_id":"Figshare_19778806","identifier":"19778806","license":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17","funding":{"funder":{"name":"This work was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [Grant No. DGE 1607310], Graduate Research Development Program and a George E. and Hester B.

Despite their unsupervised nature, these models can be implemented in semi-supervised learning scenarios by treating the class labels as additional latent variables. In this paper, we propose a deep generative model for semi-supervised learning that offsets label noise, which is a ubiquitous feature in large-scale datasets owing to the high cost of annotation. We assume that noisy labels are generated from true labels and employ a noise transition matrix to describe the transition. We estimate this matrix by adjusting its entries to minimize its difference with the true transition matrix and use the estimated matrix to formulate the objective function for inference, which consists of an evidence lower bound and a classification risk. However, because directly minimizing the latter with noisy labels may result in an inaccurate classifier, we propose a statistically consistent estimator for computing the classification risk solely with noisy data. Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model improves the classification performance over that of the baseline algorithms. We also present a case study on semiconductor manufacturing.

In this study, gene and protein levels were respectively determined by RT-qPCR or Western blotting. OSa cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis were evaluated via CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays. To assess the glycolysis level, glucose consumption and lactate production were detected. It was found S100A10 was highly expressed in OSa tissues and cell lines. Besides, S100A10 facilitated proliferation and metastasis, and inhibited apoptosis in OSa cells. In addition, S100A10 regulated OSa cell proliferation, metastasis and apoptosis via mediating the glycolysis process. Furthermore, S100A10-mediated AKT/mTOR signaling accelerated glycolysis, thereby promoting malignant behaviors in OSa cells.

To date, most\nof the MOF surface modifications have been performed either by physical\nadsorption or chemical association of small molecules or (preformed)\npolymers. However, most of the currently employed approaches cannot\nprecisely control the polymer density, and dynamic modifications at\nthe surfaces on demand have been a challenging task. Here, we introduce\na general approach based on covalent modification employing alkoxyamines\nas a versatile tool to modify the outer surface of MOF nanoparticles\n(NPs). The alkoxyamines serve as initiators to grow polymers from\nthe MOF surface via nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) and allow\ndynamic attachment of small molecules via a nitroxide exchange reaction\n(NER). The successful surface modification and successive surface\npolymerization are confirmed via time-of-flight secondary ion mass\nspectrometry (ToF-SIMS), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The functionalized\nMOF NPs exhibit high suspension stability and good dispersibility\nwhile retaining their chemical integrity and crystalline structure.\nIn addition, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) studies\nprove the dynamic exchange of two different nitroxide species via\nNER and further allow us to quantify the surface modification with\nhigh sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that alkoxyamines serve\nas a versatile tool to dynamically modify the surface of MOF NPs with\nhigh precision, allowing us to tailor their properties for a wide\nrange of potential applications, such as drug delivery or mixed matrix\nmembranes.","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/Langmuir","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c00085.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35141692"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Dynamic_Surface_Modification_of_Metal_Organic_Framework_Nanoparticles_via_Alkoxyamine_Functional_Groups/19779829","_id":"Figshare_19779829","identifier":"19779829","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

Nevertheless, a long-time high-temperature\nheat treatment is required in traditional preparation methods, leading\nto low synthesis efficiency and waste of energy. Herein, an ultrafast\npreparation method of layered transition-metal oxides was proposed\nthrough minute calcination of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).\nThe homogeneous distribution of different atoms in MOFs allows fast\nphase transition during the calcination process.

Emotional exhaustion was significantly associated with insomnia with a moderate to large effect size, when controlling for covariates. Depersonalization, but not personal achievement, was also significantly associated with insomnia.

Reductions in prey, driven by changes in environmental conditions can manifest in reduced fat stores that are visible on whales. We developed a non-invasive technique using photographs of blue whales taken on the US west coast from 2005-2018 (n=3,660) and scored body condition based on visible undulations from the vertebral processes and body shape. We analyzed patterns in the body condition of whales across years and their relation to oceanographic conditions. Females with calves had significantly poorer body conditions and calves had significantly better body conditions compared to other adult whales (Chi-Square, x<sup>2 =</sup> 170.36, df=6, p<2.2e-16). Year was a significant factor in body condition (Chi-Square, x<sup>2 =</sup> 417.73, df=39, p<0.001). The highest proportion of whales in poor body condition was observed for 2015 (one of the only two years along with 2017 where >50% had poor body condition) coincides with the marine heat wave that affected the NE Pacific 2014-2016. A cumulative mixed model examining the relationship between body condition and environmental variables revealed that negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation and longer upwelling seasons correlated with better blue whale body condition, likely to be due to higher primary productivity and prey availability.

A group of scientists from several fields, gathered to debate the prospect of developing an artificial brain in the 1940s and 1950s. Afterwards, in 1956, the term AI was first coined by John McCarthy at Dartmouth College, where he convinced his fellow scientists of the potential power of the field in the future. In the following years, thanks to the technological developments, the investments by various large companies started in the hope of achieving an artificial intelligent being; however, due to the ethical issues and some reports denouncing the AI in the 1970s, the investments by these organizations and the government lowered sharply. Fortunately, the interest in the field was revived in the late 80s, when the UK began the large scale of investments in the field in order to compete with the developments taking place in Japan. Those investments continued until today, causing AI to flourish day-by-day and making it one of the most important technologies that people cannot imagine their lives without. Unlike human intelligence, which is more prone to errors and not efficient in terms of repetitive tasks, artificial intelligence is able to process tons of data in a very short period of time, thus boosting the efficacy in the systems. Even though AI is generally seen as a hazardous technology in public eye, it helps people in many aspects of their lives and has beneficial current and future applications in several industries, most common ones being in healthcare, manufacturing, and education.</p>","dateModified":"2022-05-17","sdPublisher":"figshare","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Online resource"]},"doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.19779511.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35141278"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/The_Application_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Industry_pdf/19779511","_id":"Figshare_19779511","identifier":"19779511","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}

The aim of this study was to conduct a multi-scale analysis of the sagittal otoliths of the <i>Merlucius merlucius</i> (European Hake) from the wester Adriatic Sea in order to correlate otolith features with fish ontogeny and sex. We show that otoliths of sexually undifferentiated (non-sexed) individuals having a fish body total length (TL) less than 15 cm had faster growth in length, width, area, perimeter, volume and weight and a higher amount of organic matrix compared to otoliths of sexually differentiated individuals (females and males) having a fish size range of 15–50 cm. Most importantly, with increasing fish TL, female saccular otoliths contained higher number of protuberances and rougher surface compared to male specimens which showed more uniform mean curvature density. The differences between females and males discovered in this study could be associated with fish hearing adaptation to reproductive behavioural strategies during the spawning season. The outcomes of this research provide insights on how size and sex-related variations in otolith features may be affected by fish ecological and behavioural patterns.","dateModified":"2022-05-04","sdPublisher":"The Royal Society/Royal Society Open Science","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.19706497.v2","url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Additional_methods_figures_and_tables_from_Multiscale_analysis_on_otolith_structural_features_reveals_differences_in_ontogenesis_and_sex_in_i_merluccius_merluccius_i_in_the_western_Adriatic/19706497","_id":"Figshare_19706497","identifier":"19706497","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-05-17"}
