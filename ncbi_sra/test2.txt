As a first step of this project, we constructed a fosmid library from the DNA directly isolated from the microbial mat without cultivation. Since we could get about 3,500 fosmid clones, we determined the paired-end sequence of all fosmid clones. We selected putative archaeal genome fragments from the metagenomic library. Total of 132 fosmids were grouped into each 13 or 20 fosmid and each group was analyzed in a half plate of 454 GS20. In addition, 18 fosmids were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. A composite archaeal genome was reconstructed from 91 complete or partial fosmid sequences.", "cell_line": null, "cell_lines": null, "strain": null, "cell type": null, "cell line name": null, "tissue type": null, "AWS_url": "https://sra-pub-run-odp.s3.amazonaws.com/sra/DRR000358/DRR000358", "AWS_free_egress": "worldwide", "AWS_access_type": "anonymous", "tissue_type": null, "cell line": null, "notes": null, "note": null, "common name": null, "cultivar": null, "ena_fastq_http": null, "ena_fastq_http_1": null, "ena_fastq_http_2": null, "ena_fastq_ftp": null, "ena_fastq_ftp_1": null, "ena_fastq_ftp_2": null, "lab_name": "RIKEN Omics Science Center, Yokohama Institute, RI", "lat_lon": null, "environmental_sample": null, "population": null, "HapMap sample ID": null, "Cell line": null, "dev_stage": null, "collection_date": null, "chromosome": null, "sample treatment": null, "sample_treatment": null, "serovar": null, "subsp.": null, "sex": null, "comment": null, "tissue appendix": null, "ecotype": null, "Yoshichika Arakawa": null, "Makoto Ohnishi": null, "Akira Hishinuma": null, "isolate": null, "sra_url_alt": null, "Cell type": null, "readGroupTag": null, "proportion": null, "memberName": null, "accession": null, "Accession": null, "age": null}
