The primary purpose of these solutions, such as the addition of spoiler baffles, is to break a culvert’s uniform flow into more natural heterogeneous flows with a series of high and low-velocity zones (HVZs and LVZs). This allows fish to pass when encountering HVZs in burst mode and to use LVZs as resting locations. Although quantitative assessments of various retrofitting solutions have shown improved culvert passage, a detailed understanding of the hydrodynamic requirements within these zones is not well established, especially for Southern Hemisphere small-bodied fish. In this study, a behavioural and hydrodynamic assessment of HVZs and LVZs was undertaken for Galaxias maculatus, a widespread small-bodied freshwater species of the Southern Hemisphere. Fish were studied in a laboratory flume whilst passing an area covered with spoiler baffles. Resting locations and upstream swimming pathways were delineated. Hydrodynamic characteristics for the identified regions of interest allowed for a comparative assessment of the studied spoiler baffle arrangements. We show that G. maculatus upstream swimming pathways predominantly cover areas with water velocity below 0.3 m/s, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) below 0.015 m2/s2. Horizontal Reynolds stresses and hydraulic drag are also calculated to characterise relevant areas. Identified resting locations have water velocities of less than 0.2 m/s and TKE below 0.012 m2/s2. Finally, a comparative assessment of spoiler baffle arrangements shows that a medium density patch generates more areas of desired HVZs and LVZs than the other tested patches. It is, therefore, recommended to test an arrangement of medium density spoiler baffles as a viable passage solution at a culvert’s full-length scale and varying slope.</p>","dateModified":"2022-09-21","sdPublisher":{"name":"University of Auckland"},"@type":"Dataset","doi":"10.17608/k6.auckland.21081262.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/37558837"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Resting_locations_and_upstream_swimming_pathways_of_Galaxias_maculatus_in_response_to_spoiler_baffle_hydrodynamics/21081262","_id":"Figshare_21081262","identifier":"21081262","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-09-21","funding":{"funder":{"name":"New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Endeavour Fund Contract (CO1X1615)","identifier":"0"}}}

Challenges in achieving building energy-efficiency at scale highlight the complexity of the building performance problem, which is embedded with social, cultural, physical, environmental, and economic factors. Traditional approaches to building design have difficulty accounting for these multi-faceted variables and related longitudinal barriers and intangible impacts. Firstly, key stakeholders and their economic constraints change throughout time, and this variability is not traditionally considered upfront or addressed throughout a building’s operation. Secondly, buildings have social, cultural, environmental and economic implications that are difficult to quantify and evaluate against strictly functional design objectives. Therefore, current deeply technical and often system-specific building design strategies could benefit from whole-building solutions that account for this complexity and enable a paradigm shift in design toward human-centered outcomes (i.e., well-being, health, financial sustainability) and effective (i.e., equitable and sustainable) buildings. </p>\n<p>To drive this shift, an impact-based innovation framework was employed to pursue system-level and ecosystem-level strategies to optimize longitudinal building value assessment and distribution. First, a grounded theory study was pursued which identified gaps in current design practice that miss underlying building subsystem interactions which influence building performance. A system-level taxonomy of the building was then defined, linking identified sub-system synergies to functional, emotional and social building benefits for inhabitants. Then, an exploratory mixed-methods study was pursued, yielding a longitudinal building value framework that helps characterize key stakeholders, building design choices, and shared efficacy metrics. Building on these inputs, a multi-stakeholder, longitudinal building value assessment model was developed. The model was tested on two residential building development scenarios, highlighting its ability to capture the true impact of buildings on affected stakeholders over time in terms of tangible and intangible building costs and benefits. Finally, business model innovation concepts were employed to identify specific changes in stakeholder value delivery and capture strategies that could redistribute building costs and benefits over time, and thereby facilitate a shift in the paradigm of design and value capture in the residential building industry. </p>","dateModified":"2022-06-17","sdPublisher":"Purdue University Graduate School/Civil Engineering","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":"Thesis or dissertation"},"doi":"10.25394/pgs.19880122.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35501825"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/thesis/REIMAGINING_BUILDING_EFFICACY_AN_EXPLORATORY_STUDY/19880122","_id":"Figshare_19880122","identifier":"19880122","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-09-21"}

C) Purified vivaxin proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% NUPAGE SDS/polyacrylamide gel (under reducing conditions) and stained with Sypro orange. M: molecular mass marker. The gel showed a prominent band with apparent molecular mass of 50kDa for each recombinant protein. The antigens have a predicted molecular mass of 34-39kDa based on amino acid sequence alone, i.e. before glycosylation. Based on the extinction coefficient calculation, the purified proteins had a concentration of 4.3mg/mL (antigen 1; VIVβ11), 5.1mg/mL (antigen 2; VIVβ14), 9.8mg/mL (antigen 3; VIVβ20) and 2.5 mg/mL (antigen 4; VIVβ8). Note that the weaker, higher molecular mass bands that were also observed for all antigens are likely due to co-purifying proteins from the tissue culture supernatant. Smearing in the bands is probably due to variation in glycosylation.

Its central part, i.e. the apex of the Ridge, is characterised by a flat or gently sloping seafloor, where three mud volcanoes, and 250 pockmarks are recognised. Differently, the western and eastern Ridge flanks are steeper and characterised by 60 quasi-rectilinear escarpments and small ridges, more than 20 morphological highs, and elongated channels occasionally floored by bedforms. The seafloor shallower than 40 m is covered by <i>Posidonia oceanica</i>, forming compact and continuous or fragmented meadows intermingled with sandy patches. The main map represents the bathy-morphological setting of the area, which is largely affected by fluid seepage, providing insights for habitat mapping and preliminary marine geohazard assessment due to the violent gas outburst from mud volcanoes.</p>","dateModified":"2022-09-21","sdPublisher":"Taylor & Francis Group/Journal of Maps","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.21182831.v1","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/37558388"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Seafloor_characterisation_of_the_offshore_sector_around_Scoglio_d_Affrica_islet_Tuscan_Archipelago_northern_Tyrrhenian_sea_/21182831","_id":"Figshare_21182831","identifier":"21182831","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-09-21","funding":{"funder":{"name":"This research was funded by Sapienza University project ‘MARENDOGAS ’ and by the ‘dipartimento d’eccellenza’ project.

Despite the great value and fragility of these ecosystems, an up-to-date overview of extent and type of alpine pastures is lacking in many areas of the Alps. In this study, the interpretation of ancillary information combined with expeditious field campaigns, and the harmonization of classification methodologies allowed us to: (1) define the spatial extent of mountain pastures; (2) identify the non-grazeable percentage in these areas; (3) Characterize and map pasture types within the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), where 4596 ha of grazeable areas were mapped. Among the 13 categories identified, the three most represented in the park are Bare thermophile grasslands (38%), Nardus swards (20%), and Alpine intermediate grasslands (18%).

During charge–discharge\ncycling LCO exhibits phase transformations that are significantly\ncomplicated by electron correlation. While the bulk phase diagram\nfor an ensemble of battery particles has been studied extensively,\nit remains unclear how these phases scale to nanometer dimensions\nand the effects of strain and diffusional anisotropy at the single-particle\nscale. Understanding these effects is critical to modeling battery\nperformance and for predicting the scalability and performance of\nelectrocatalysts and ECRAM. Here we investigate isolated, epitaxial\nLiCoO<sub>2</sub> islands grown by pulsed laser deposition. After\nelectrochemical cycling of the islands, conductive atomic force microscopy\n(c-AFM) is used to image the spatial distribution of conductive and\ninsulating phases. Above 20 nm island thicknesses, we observe a kinetically\narrested state in which the phase boundary is perpendicular to the\nLi-planes; we propose a model and present image analysis results that\nshow smaller LCO islands have a higher conductive fraction than larger\narea islands, and the overall conductive fraction is consistent with\nthe lithiation state. Thinner islands (14 nm), with a larger surface\nto volume ratio, are found to exhibit a striping pattern, which suggests\nsurface energy can dominate below a critical dimension. When increasing\nforce is applied through the AFM tip to strain the LCO islands, significant\nshifts in current flow are observed, and underlying mechanisms for\nthis behavior are discussed. The c-AFM images are compared with photoemission\nelectron microscopy images, which are used to acquire statistics across\nhundreds of particles. The results indicate that strain and morphology\nbecome more critical to electrochemical performance as particles approach\nnanometer dimensions.","dateModified":"2022-09-21","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/ACS Nano","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/acsnano.2c05594.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/37557767"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Imaging_Phase_Segregation_in_Nanoscale_Li_sub_i_x_i_sub_CoO_sub_2_sub_Single_Particles/21182213","_id":"Figshare_21182213","identifier":"21182213","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-09-21"}

Field water is usually pathogenic because of various soluble\nand insoluble contaminants. In this study, fish-gill-like biomimetic\ncore–shell-structured nanofiber membranes are designed and\nsynthesized by an <i>in situ</i> oxidation polymerization\ncoating process. A polyimide nanofiber membrane and a polypyrrole\n(PPy) coating layer are employed as a core and shell, respectively.\nThe biomimetic membranes exhibit dual-functional capacities: a rapid\nremoval of insoluble contaminants owing to the highly porous network\nand broad-spectrum adsorption of soluble contaminants enabled by the\nPPy shell. Model studies confirm the excellent ability of the membranes\nto purify Cr(VI)-contaminated water to drinkable water with a safe\ncapacity of ∼1415 L m<sup>–2</sup>. Actual application\ntests show that the membrane can efficiently remove coliform and suspended\nsolids in a muddy water sample taken from a river in Suzhou, China.\nThis study provides a promising route for the design of a single-layer\nmembrane with dual functions for highly efficient RPWP.","dateModified":"2022-09-21","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/acsami.2c12537.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/37557689"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Biomimetic_Core_Shell-Structured_Nanofiber_Membranes_for_Rapid_and_Portable_Water_Purification/21182135","_id":"Figshare_21182135","identifier":"21182135","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-09-21"}

B: Median gene copy number profiles of the three T-PLL subgroups. Chromosomes are separated by dotted vertical lines and the median copy number values of genes are shown by small colored dots. The color of these dots is altered with the chromosome according to the subgroup-specific base color to enable a better visual separation between chromosomes. Strong deviations of median values from zero indicate frequently observed deletions (negative log-ratios) and duplications (positive log-ratios) of genes in the corresponding subgroup. Red circles depict strongly negative median copy number log-ratios that were outside of the plotted range (<i>PRSS1</i>: SG1 and SG3, <i>HLA-DRB5</i> and <i>LGALS9C</i>: SG2).</p>","dateModified":"2022-09-21","sdPublisher":"Public Library of Science/PLOS ONE","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Image","Figure"]},"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0274463.g005","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/37557674"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/figure/Genome-wide_gene_copy_number_profiles_of_T-PLL_samples_/21182117","_id":"Figshare_21182117","identifier":"21182117","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-09-21"}

It has been shown that bilayers\nformed from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and chitin nanofibers (ChNFs)\nexhibit oxygen barrier properties similar to polyethylene terephthalate\n(PET). However, this prior work explored only coating each layer individually\nin sequence through techniques such as spray coating. Here, we demonstrate\nthe viability of dual-layer slot die coating of CNC/ChNF bilayers\nonto cellulose acetate (CA) substrates. The dual-layer slot die method\nenables significantly lower oxygen permeability versus spray coating\nwhile using a roll-to-roll system that applies the bilayer in a single\npass. This work discusses suspension properties, wetting, and drying\nconditions required to achieve well-controlled ChNF/CNC bilayers.\nSpray-coated bilayer films were on average 25% thinner than the dual-layer\nbilayer film; however, the thickness-normalized oxygen permeability\n(OP) of the dual-layer-coated ChNF/CNC bilayer film on CA was 20 times\nbetter than that of the spray-coated bilayers. It has been shown that\nChNF contributes to the wetting and barrier properties. Values of\nOP for the slot die-coated bilayers under optimized drying conditions\nwere as low as 1.2 cm<sup>3</sup>·μm·m<sup>–2</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>·kPa<sup>−1</sup>, corresponding\nto a normalized oxygen transmission rate of 0.32 cm<sup>3</sup>·m<sup>–2</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup> at 23 °C and 50%\nrelative humidity. It is also noted that the adhesive properties of\nthe dual-layer coating are also improved when films are air-dried\nand that ChNF contributes to the wetting and barrier properties.","dateModified":"2022-09-21","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/acsami.2c09925.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/37557589"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Roll-to-Roll_Dual-Layer_Slot_Die_Coating_of_Chitin_and_Cellulose_Oxygen_Barrier_Films_for_Renewable_Packaging/21182035","_id":"Figshare_21182035","identifier":"21182035","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-09-21"}

The activated MR translocates to the nucleus, where it binds the mineralocorticoid response element (MRE) in genomic DNA. This complex, together with SP1 and other transcription factor(s) and other co-regulator(s), activates the transcription initiation complex and thereby promotes <i>SLC12A3</i> gene transcription and NCC protein translation. Although both MR (aldosterone) and GR (cortisol, corticosterone etc.) hormones potentially bind to MRE, the presence of 11βHSD2 in the DCT, especially DCT2, converts cortisol (humans)/corticosterone (rodents) to cortisone, which facilitates MR binding to MRE. (<b>B</b>) Vpr, binding either MR or SP1 and other transcription factors, abrogates the interaction of MR and MRE and thus prevents <i>SLC12A3</i> transcription and translation. This reduces the abundance of NCC in the apical membranes of distal convoluted tubules. Considering that plasma aldosterone levels in Tg mice were similar to those of WT mice, and aldosterone concentrations were increased by salt depletion in both groups, Vpr did not impair aldosterone synthesis and regulation system in Tg mice. Of note, MREs can be located within intron or other regions of the gene, although it is illustrated here in the promoter region of <i>SLC12A3</i>.</p>","dateModified":"2022-09-21","sdPublisher":"Public Library of Science/PLOS ONE","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Image","Figure"]},"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0273313.g007","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/37557466"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/figure/A_schematic_model_of_Vpr_suppression_of_i_SLC12A3_i_transcription_activity_in_the_distal_convoluted_tubule_/21181915","_id":"Figshare_21181915","identifier":"21181915","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-09-21"}

However, relative to adults, the characteristics of EFRs elicited by frequency-specific speech and their utility in predicting audibility in children are unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>Method: </strong>EFRs were elicited by the first (F1) and second and higher formants (F2+) of male-spoken vowels /u/ and /i/ and by fricatives /ʃ/ and /s/ in the token /suʃi/ presented at 15, 35, 55, 65, and 75 dB SPL. The F1, F2+, and fricatives were low-, mid-, and high-frequency dominant, respectively.

Sensation levels of stimuli were estimated based on behavioral thresholds.</p>\n<p><strong>Results:</strong> In children, amplitude decreased with age for /ʃ/-elicited EFRs but remained stable for low- and mid-frequency stimuli. As a group, EFR amplitude and phase coherence did not differ from that of adults. EFR sensitivity (proportion of audible stimuli detected) and specificity (proportion of inaudible stimuli not detected) did not vary between children and adults. Consistent with previous work, EFR sensitivity increased with stimulus frequency and level.

For this reaction to occur, the presence\nof a distonic radical site on the precursor ion is thought to be a\nprerequisite. Herein, we report that oxygen adduct formation can take\nplace also with deprotonated hydroquinone, which in fact is an even-electron\nspecies without a radical site. When the product-ion spectrum of the <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 109 ion, generated by electrospray\nionization from a solution of hydroquinone in acetonitrile, was recorded\nunder ion-mobility conditions, a new peak was observed at <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 141. However, an analogous peak was\nnot visible in the spectrum acquired under nonmobility conditions\n(i.e., without any gas introduced to the mobility cell). Presumably,\ntraces of oxygen present in the collision gas instigate an ion–molecule\nreaction to produce an adduct of <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 141, which upon activation results in CO and H<sub>2</sub>O loss\nto form a product ion of <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 95.\nIsotope-labeling studies confirmed that one of the hydrogen atoms\nfrom the hydroxy group and another from the aromatic ring contribute\nto the water loss instigated from the <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 141 adduct. Furthermore, computational methods indicated the three-dimensional\nstructure of the ground-state deprotonated hydroquinone to be distinctly\ndifferent from those of its 1,2- and 1,3-isomers. Calculations predicted\nthat all atoms in the two <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 109\nions generated from catechol and resorcinol lie on one plane. In contrast,\nthe structure of the <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 109 ion\nfrom hydroquinone was significantly different. Computations predicted\nthat the hydrogen atom on the intact hydroxyl group of deprotonated\nhydroquinone protrudes out of plane from rest of the atoms. Consequently,\nthe exposed OH group can interact with an incoming dioxygen molecule.\nComputations conducted at the CAM-B3LYP/6-311++g­(2d,2p) level of theory\ndetected a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) at −4.3 kJ\nmol<sup>–1</sup> below the separated O<sub>2</sub> + deprotonated\nhydroquinone triplet threshold. In contrast, similar calculations\nconducted for catechol and resorcinol yielded MECPs of +116.9  and\n+69.1 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>, respectively, above the associated\ntriplet thresholds. These results indicated that the curve crossing\nrequired to form singlet products upon reaction with triplet O<sub>2</sub> is favorable in the case of hydroquinone and unfavorable\nin the cases of catechol and resorcinol. In practical terms, the selective\noxygen addition appears to be a diagnostically useful reaction to\ndifferentiate hydroquinone from its ring isomers.","dateModified":"1753-01-01","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/jasms.1c00222.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/37556638"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Evidence_of_Gas-Phase_Attachment_of_Molecular_Oxygen_to_Deprotonated_Hydroquinone_During_Ion-Mobility_Mass_Spectrometry/21181105","_id":"Figshare_21181105","identifier":"21181105","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"1753-01-01"}

In optogenetics, photoreceptors achieve the reversible,\nnon-invasive, and spatiotemporally precise control by light of gene\nexpression and other cellular processes. The light-oxygen-voltage\nreceptor PAL binds to small RNA aptamers with sequence specificity\nupon blue-light illumination. By embedding the responsive aptamer\nin the ribosome-binding sequence of genes of interest, their expression\ncan be downregulated by light. We developed the pCrepusculo and pAurora\noptogenetic systems that are based on PAL and allow to down- and upregulate,\nrespectively, bacterial gene expression using blue light. Both systems\nare realized as compact, single plasmids that exhibit stringent blue-light\nresponses with low basal activity and up to several 10-fold dynamic\nrange. As PAL exerts light-dependent control at the RNA level, it\ncan be combined with other optogenetic circuits that control transcription\ninitiation. By integrating regulatory mechanisms operating at the\nDNA and mRNA levels, optogenetic circuits with emergent properties\ncan thus be devised. As a case in point, the pEnumbra setup permits\nto upregulate gene expression under moderate blue light whereas strong\nblue light shuts off expression again. Beyond providing novel signal-responsive\nexpression systems for diverse applications in biotechnology and synthetic\nbiology, our work also illustrates how the light-dependent PAL-aptamer\ninteraction can be harnessed for the control and interrogation of\nRNA-based processes.","dateModified":"2022-09-21","sdPublisher":"American Chemical Society/ACS Synthetic Biology","@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"doi":"10.1021/acssynbio.2c00365.s001","distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/37556635"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Light-Dependent_Control_of_Bacterial_Expression_at_the_mRNA_Level/21181102","_id":"Figshare_21181102","identifier":"21181102","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-09-21"}

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of finding motivated healthy volunteers for the development of new vaccines. Public registers represent a promising way to promote the participation of healthy volunteers in the research field, but their adoption is still limited. The current study aimed to explore the motivations of healthy volunteers to enrol in an Italian public register for clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic and their attitude toward participating in a phase 1 COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. The impacts of different enrolling interview modalities (in person, by phone, by mail) on motivation, understanding of information and trust in researchers were also investigated.</p>\n<p><strong>Methods:</strong> An online survey investigating experience with COVID-19, motivations to enrol, trust in researchers, political and healthcare authorities and pharmacological companies was presented to people applying as healthy volunteers in the public register for clinical trials at Phase 1 Unit Research Centre of ASST Monza, Italy, and considering to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. Data were collected in June 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>Results:</strong> Altruistic motivations were the main driver for enrolling in the public register, while self-interested motivations were secondary. No gender differences were found. As for enrolling modalities, no differences emerged between in-person and interviews for motivation to enrol, understanding of information and trust in researchers. Email modality led to significantly lower volunteers' satisfaction and understanding of information but similar trust in research.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> This study supports the validity of different interview modalities (in person and by phone) for the enrolment of healthy volunteers for clinical trials and highlights the positive role of public registers for the recruitment procedures.</p>","dateModified":"2022-09-21","sdPublisher":{"name":"Springer Nature"},"@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/37512205"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Why_not_Motivations_for_entering_a_volunteer_register_for_clinical_trials_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic/21155851","_id":"Figshare_21155851","identifier":"21155851","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-09-21","funding":{"funder":{"name":"Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi di Milano - Bicocca within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.","identifier":"0"}}}

Key data is drawn from the GreenCOVID study across Spain, England and Ireland. The survey gathered contextual information about home environments, neighborhood spaces, and access to nature elements, and standardized measures of health and wellbeing between April and July 2020 (<em>n</em> = 3,127). The paper used qualitative data from the survey to document flows between home and nearby nature. These were framed as barriers/mediators with specific focus on differing interpretations of home as both trap and refuge, with additional dimensions of loss, disruption and interruption shaping the broad responses to the pandemic. By contrast nearby nature was an enabler/moderator of health and wellbeing, offering healthy flows between home and nature as well as respite and additional health-enabling factors. Differences were identified between the three countries but important commonalities emerged too, recognising the role nature plays as an asset both within and immediately beyond the home. The use of flow as metaphor also recognises the importance of embodiment and the elastic nature of connections between home and nearby nature for wellbeing. More broadly, flow provides a valuable way to trace affective relational geographers to develop a wider understanding of assemblages of health during pandemics. </p>","dateModified":"2022-09-21","sdPublisher":{"name":"Elsevier B.V."},"@type":"Collection","hasPart":{"@type":["Text","Journal contribution"]},"distribution":{"url":"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/37549840"},"url":"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Home_and_nearby_nature_uncovering_relational_flows_between_domestic_and_natural_spaces_in_three_countries_during_COVID-19/21155869","_id":"Figshare_21155869","identifier":"21155869","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","datePublished":"2022-09-21"}
